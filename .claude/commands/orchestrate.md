# Orchestrate — Run an ordered chain of blocks through the SDLC engines, in one session.

Takes an ordered list of work blocks and drives each one end-to-end: spec → (breakdown) →
engine → integrate → verify state → next. The engines run as **background workflows**, so while
one block builds, this command prepares the specs for the blocks behind it.

One `/orchestrate` session drives one repo. Run several repos at once — that is the lane model.


**Before writing down anything that is wrong, follow
[`.claude/workflows/finding-discipline.md`](../workflows/finding-discipline.md).** Evidence travels
with the finding or the finding does not exist; one occurrence is an instance, not a pattern; and an
odd-but-unexplained thing is recorded as an **observation** rather than inflated into a defect. The
cut list is part of the report — a pass that files everything it noticed has not filtered. Measured:
three independent audits found 32%/32%/26% of filed carryover already dead.

## Variables

$ARGUMENTS — one of:
- **Inline list:** ordered block IDs or spec slugs, space- or comma-separated.
  `/orchestrate OK.3.A OK.3.B`
- **Lane-file path:** a single `lane-<name>.json` path, authored against
  `.claude/workflows/lane.schema.json` (D71). Read its `blocks[]` array — **array order IS chain
  order** — and take each entry's `id`. The argument stays a single path; there is no second
  argument for a lane file.
  `/orchestrate planning/bullet-proof-software/lane-okf-core.json`
- **Flags:**
  - `--worktree` — **require** worktree isolation for every block in the chain. See step 5.
  - `--no-worktree` — force plain-branch/in-place for every block, overriding any per-repo default.
  - `--engine <task|flow>` — force one engine for every block, overriding recommendations.
  - `--dry-run` — resolve the chain, generate the specs, print the plan. Run no engines.
  - `--stop-on-fail` (default) / `--continue-on-fail`.
  - `--stop-after <N>` — stop the chain cleanly after `N` blocks have integrated, releasing the
    repo lease and registry claim exactly as at ordinary lane close (`begin-orchestration.md`'s
    lane-close release), then reporting the remaining chain the way an early stop already does.
    Nothing today stops a lane at all — that gap is why the last run stopped for an ad-hoc reason
    (a stale global-command snapshot, base-template standing rule 10) instead of a decision. This
    flag and `--autonomy` below are the two honest, nameable stop conditions: "stop after this many
    blocks" and "stop when this needs a human." **These are flags, not lane-record fields**, because
    they describe *this run*, not the lane: `.claude/workflows/lane.schema.json` is validated by
    mev's `LaneRecord`, which is `deny_unknown_fields` — every field added to it is a cross-repo
    add-then-install before any lane can read it, the exact cost
    `base-template:BT.ticket.lane-schema-has-no-home-for-the-briefing` already paid. A per-run
    knob belongs on the invocation, not on data a sibling lane's tooling must also parse.
  - `--autonomy <level>` — how far this lane may go without the operator before stopping. Same
    per-run reasoning as `--stop-after`: it governs this invocation, not the lane, so it is a flag.
    This command does not define the level vocabulary; take whatever the operator passes and stop
    at the next point rule 11's "not yours to decide alone" list would otherwise require a call.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, stop and print:
```
Usage: /orchestrate <block-id> [block-id ...]
       /orchestrate <path-to-lane-name.json>
       Flags: --worktree --no-worktree --engine <task|flow> --dry-run --continue-on-fail
              --stop-after <N> --autonomy <level>
```

## Standing rules

Each of these exists because it has already caused a real failure in this fleet.

1. **Never do block work yourself, and never delegate it to a subagent.** Every block in the chain
   goes through **`/sdlc-task` or `/sdlc-flow`** — those engines spawn their own internal agents,
   which is theirs to do. A block implemented by an ad-hoc subagent has no spec, no gate, no state
   write, and no review; it is indistinguishable from work that never happened, and the chain's
   verification in step 8 will not catch it because the state write will look fine.

   You may spawn a subagent for **exactly two things**: read-only exploration (finding files,
   answering a factual question about the codebase), and a long hotfix that has **no block of its
   own**. Everything else — `/generate-tasks`, `/breakdown`, integration, state verification,
   conflict resolution — runs **inline in this session**.

   If you find yourself about to write code for a block ID, stop: that is an engine's job.
2. **Only `sdlc-task` and `sdlc-flow`.** These are the only two engines `/generate-tasks` may
   recommend; if it recommends anything else, stop and report — this command only handles their
   isolation and merge semantics.
3. **One repo per session, one engine run at a time.** Both engines take the repo's branch or
   working tree. Never launch a second engine workflow in the same repo before the first has
   completed and integrated.
4. **Never start a block with unmet dependencies.** See step 2.
5. **Verify every state write.** The engines' status bookkeeping is known-unreliable
   (`base-template:BT.ticket.sdlc-state-write-reliability` — agent-prompt-driven, skipped in
   worktree mode). Trust nothing; check it (step 8).
6. **Check downstream consumers after any block touching a shared crate's public surface** (step
   9). No lane can see a sibling lane running in a different repo — this is the only thing in this
   command that looks outside its own repo, and it exists because the alternative (nothing looked)
   has already broken two other repos mid-run.

7. **Commit immediately after any `mev` command or roadmap edit.** `mev emit-state --write`,
   `set-block-status`, `defer-epic`/`resume-epic`/`sync-epics`, and any roadmap or plan edit all
   mutate files that **sibling lanes read**. An uncommitted state change is invisible to them and
   will be clobbered by the next agent that writes the same file. Commit the `state.json` plus its
   regenerated surfaces as their own commit *before* launching the next engine — not batched at the
   end of the chain.

8. **Report progress where sibling lanes can see it.** After each block integrates, append one line
   to the run's lane log and commit it:

   ```
   {"ts":"<ISO-8601>","lane":"<lane-name>","repo":"<repo>","block":"<ID>","status":"closed|bailed|held","note":"<one line>"}
   ```

   The log lives at **`planning/roadmaps/<slug>/lane-log.jsonl`** — resolve `<slug>` via
   `/begin-orchestration`'s Step 1D rule: the driving roadmap's directory name, or the operator's
   `--run <slug>` verbatim when the chain has no roadmap. Never a hardcoded `planning/<slug>/`.

   **A run with no roadmap is still a run and still leaves a lane log.** It takes its slug from
   `/begin-orchestration --run <slug>` — an operator-named flag, never derived here. **Do not invent
   one:** an invented slug is not reproducible, so a second run of the same work opens a second
   record instead of appending to the first (measured 2026-09-05, when a carryover chain named
   itself by hand mid-session).

   > **Corrected 2026-09-06.** This rule previously said a roadmap-less run's log goes to
   > `planning/orchestration-run/<run-slug>/`, "the same convention already on disk for
   > `harness-hardening` and `carryover-improvements`." Both citations were false: `harness-hardening`
   > has no `lane-log.jsonl` anywhere, and `carryover-improvements` keeps its under
   > `planning/roadmaps/` because it *is* a roadmap. The real split is **lane log and escalations
   > under `planning/roadmaps/<slug>/`; the run record under
   > `planning/orchestration-run/<slug>/`** — one directory per axis, whether or not a roadmap
   > document exists. A `--run` chain creates the former with no `roadmap.md` and no lane records in
   > it, which is exactly how `scripts/lane_log_watermark.py`'s `is_roadmap_dir()` already tells a
   > roadmap from something else.

   **Do not hand-edit a roadmap's generated regions.** Run `mev emit-state --write` and let the
   sequence table regenerate from `state.json`, which is the authority. Four concurrent sessions
   editing one markdown file is the exact contention pattern this fleet has already been bitten by —
   the working rule is *each agent reports the state change it wants; one writer applies them
   centrally*. Per-repo `state.json` writes do not contend because they are different files; the log
   is append-only; the roadmap regenerates. That is the whole communication channel.

9. **Keep a running notes file — `planning/orchestration-run/<roadmap-slug>/notes.md` in this
   repo**, where `<roadmap-slug>` is the driving roadmap's directory name (the one from `$ARGUMENTS`
   or the list file this chain runs from) — the same directory name `/begin-orchestration` resolves
   as its `run_record_dir`, so both commands address the same record. **If the chain has no
   driving roadmap, use the same `--run` slug that fills rule 8's `<slug>` position** —
   `planning/orchestration-run/<run-slug>/notes.md` — so the record path and the lane-log path
   resolve from the same slug, in their two different directories. Do not skip this rule; a run with no roadmap still leaves evidence.
   The lane log carries one line per block for
   *sibling lanes*; this file carries everything else, for the *next session in this repo*. Defects
   found in passing, deferred fixes, decisions you took, traps re-confirmed, whatever the roadmap
   got wrong. None of it survives the session transcript otherwise, and the next agent starts blind
   and rediscovers it the hard way.

   Create the directory and file on the first block if absent; add a row to `planning/index.md`.
   **Append after every block — never rewrite; never rotate, never move to an archive.** Status
   every item so it can be triaged later: `OPEN` · `DONE` · `HELD` · `WONTFIX`. Commit it alongside
   the lane-log line (rule 7 timing: before the next engine launches).

   Required frontmatter, the `doc_id` rule, `lifecycle`, the ledger's `origin_roadmap` column, and
   the carryover-promotion rule are specified once — in `/begin-orchestration`'s Step 1E / Rule 5 —
   per `planning/decisions/D57-orchestration-run-artifact-contract.md`. Follow that contract; do not
   restate it here. In short: unresolved items never carry into a successor file — at lane close,
   promote any item still `OPEN` into `state.json` `carryover[]`.

   **Adopting a block not on this chain?** Append its ledger row **at adoption time, not at lane
   close**, with `origin_roadmap` set explicitly to that block's own driving roadmap (Rule 5's
   ledger schema — do not restate it here). A block adopted and never given a row leaves its
   home-roadmap attribution unrecoverable: it has already happened once, silently, and broke a
   downstream consolidation pass that depends on the column.

   **At lane close, reconcile the ledger against the repo's live `state.json` before stamping any
   lifecycle field.** `state.json` is the authority on which blocks are actually closed; a ledger
   row still marked `held` or `open` for a block `state.json` shows closed is stale and must be
   corrected first. Do not stamp `lane-complete` or `consolidated` over a ledger that disagrees
   with `state.json`.

   **Verify what you just wrote, before continuing** — and before the commit in rule 7/8 below.
   After every write or append to `notes.md` (and after writing the terminal `review.md`), run
   `python3 <path-to-base-template>/scripts/test_orchestration_run_contract.py` and confirm it
   exits 0, same rule and same reasoning as `/begin-orchestration`'s Rule 5 verify step — do not
   restate that reasoning here. On a violation attributable to the record just written, **fix it**
   and re-run the checker; do not proceed with a known violation. **Deleting or emptying the record
   is never an acceptable way to make the check pass.**

   Keep it a *log*, not a second `status.md`. If an item turns into real work it becomes a ticket
   and the entry points at it.

10. **Hold the repo lease across a block, never across a boundary; drain the inbox only at the
    boundary.** `/begin-orchestration` Step 4 takes the repo lease
    (`<lock_dir>/leases/lease-<repo>.json`) and the registry claim
    (`<lock_dir>/lane-agents/agent-<agent_name>.json`) before this chain starts. At the block
    boundary — step 10 below, "Re-check the next block's dependencies, then launch it" — **release
    the lease, drain this lane's inbox, then re-take the lease before launching the next block**.
    The boundary and not mid-block, because a lane stopped mid-block loses exactly the context
    that cannot be written down (base-template standing rule 10) — the lease release and the
    drain both wait for a point where nothing is in flight.

    **Draining**: this lane's queue is `<lock_dir>/queue/<repo>/<lane>/{inbox,processing,done}`.
    Use `scripts/check_messages.py`'s `drain_queue()` to move everything from `inbox/` to
    `processing/`, then `complete_message()` per message once triaged — do not restate the queue
    layout or receipts ledger here, `BT.6.B` owns both.

    **Re-stamp both heartbeats at this same boundary.** Before releasing, update the registry
    claim's `heartbeat` field (`<lock_dir>/lane-agents/agent-<agent_name>.json`) to the current
    time; after re-taking, update the lease's `heartbeat` field
    (`<lock_dir>/leases/lease-<repo>.json`) the same way. **At that same claim update, if the claim
    carries the optional `current_block` and `block_started_at` fields, re-stamp them too** — set
    `current_block` to the id of the block about to launch and `block_started_at` to the current
    time, in the same write as `heartbeat`, not a separate one. Both fields are optional; a claim
    without them is unaffected. **Leave `started_at` (on the claim) and
    `acquired_at` (on the lease) alone** — those are acquisition timestamps, not liveness signals,
    and re-stamping them destroys the record of when the claim or lease was actually taken (the
    exact data loss `BT.ticket.lane-claim-and-lease-have-no-heartbeat` fixed: a lease heartbeated
    via `acquired_at` loses its true acquisition time forever). **This is a different clock from
    the fleet-concurrency re-registration** described in Step 5 below
    (`fleet_concurrency_check.py register`, which bumps that separate
    `<lock_dir>/fleet-concurrency/...` entry's own `started_at`) — heartbeating
    the claim or the lease does not heartbeat the fleet-concurrency slot, and vice versa; do not
    conflate the two clocks or the two files.

    **In case of divergence:** the claim, the lease, and the fleet-concurrency slot are three
    separate files, each heartbeated by its own instruction — the claim/lease heartbeat happens
    at *every* block boundary (this rule); the fleet-concurrency heartbeat is periodic and only
    for a heavy repo whose chain outruns its TTL (Step 5 below, "Decide engine and isolation").


    **While no `/orchestration-commander` is running — the current arrangement — a lane is the ONLY
    reader of any inbox, including its own.** Nothing sweeps the queue tree, so a message addressed
    to a lane that is not running is read by nobody, and the sender goes on believing it has
    communicated. Measured 2026-08-23: three messages, one of them a P0, sat unread for seven hours.
    Three obligations follow, and they are the pre-commander practice restored deliberately, not a
    regression:

    1. **Ping a peer whenever a peer is affected**, rather than waiting for anything to route it for
       you — use the `ping-agent` skill's envelope and the four-verdict response contract. Every
       envelope requires `verified_by`: fill it with the literal command you ran and its real
       output when you checked the claim yourself, or `UNVERIFIED: <who claimed it>` when you are
       relaying a claim you did not independently verify — never restate someone else's finding as
       your own without one of those two.
    2. **Write every message to a durable home as well as sending it.** The ping accelerates the
       durable channel; it never replaces it. A finding that exists only as a ping dies with the
       receiving session.
    3. **Record every issue, decision and surprise in this run's
       `planning/orchestration-run/<roadmap-slug>/notes.md`**, with a status (`OPEN` / `DONE` /
       `HELD` / `WONTFIX`), even when you have also pinged someone about it. The notes file is the
       only channel that survives both sessions ending.

    Additionally, **glance at the whole queue tree at each block boundary**, not just your own
    inbox: `python3 <path-to-base-template>/scripts/check_messages.py` validates every lane's queue
    in about a second. If you see an undrained inbox belonging to a lane that is not running, say so
    in your report and in `notes.md` — surfacing it is never out of scope, even though acting on
    another lane's message is. `BT.ticket.commander-must-validate-the-whole-queue-tree` moves this
    to the commander once it is fixed.

    **Interrupt discipline**: only `RENDEZVOUS` and `LEASE_RELEASE` may interrupt a block in
    flight — both concern the tree and are objectively time-critical. Every other kind
    (`EDGE_RELEASED`, `FINDING`, `QUERY`) is triaged at the next block boundary, never before. See
    the `ping-agent` skill for the verify-before-acting rule and the four-verdict response
    contract (ACK plus ACCEPTED / VERIFIED-FALSE / DEFERRED / DECLINED) — do not restate them here.

    `--stop-after`/`--autonomy` (see Variables) stop the chain at exactly this same boundary — a
    stop releases the lease and registry claim the same way ordinary lane close does.

11. **Resolve what you can; record the call.** A chain that halts at every ambiguity is worthless,
    and one that halts at none is dangerous. Decide the ordinary things inline — an imperfect spec
    slug, which plan file `--from` means, whether a surfaced defect is in scope, how to resolve a
    merge conflict — state the assumption, and keep the chain moving. **Every such decision goes in
    the notes file with its reasoning, in a line or two.** A decision nobody can find later is
    indistinguishable from a mistake.

    Still not yours to decide alone: a bailed block's fate under `--stop-on-fail`, two blocks that
    genuinely disagree about the same behaviour, a `BROKEN DOWNSTREAM` consumer (report, never fix),
    an operator gate, and anything requiring a spec slug you cannot resolve confidently (step 3
    says stop and ask — that still stands).

12. **Urgent-item adoption.** A P0 raised mid-run may jump this chain; the full three-step
    procedure — file the block, write the ledger row **at adoption time** with `origin_roadmap` set
    explicitly (Rule 9's ledger contract), then ping the owning lane per the `ping-agent` skill — is
    defined once, in `/begin-orchestration`'s standing rules; do not restate it here. Priority still
    comes from `planning/decisions/D43-cross-domain-priority-graph.md`, never from the sender, and
    this is not licence to reorder the chain for anything below P0. No field was added to
    `.claude/workflows/lane.schema.json` for it, and no role enum exists in this fleet.

---

## How the pipeline works

The engines are **background workflows**: launching one returns immediately with a task ID, and a
`<task-notification>` arrives when it finishes. That is the concurrency this command exploits.

```
 ├─ generate spec: block 1
 ├─ LAUNCH block 1 engine ──────────────────────────┐  (background)
 │   ├─ generate spec: block 2                      │
 │   ├─ generate spec: block 3                      │  ← you keep working
 │   └─ generate spec: block 4 …                    │
 ├─ ◄── task-notification: block 1 done ────────────┘
 ├─ integrate + verify state for block 1
 ├─ LAUNCH block 2 engine (spec already written) ───┐
 │   └─ generate spec: block 5 …                    │
 └─ …                                               ┘
```

**Engine runs are serial** (rule 3); **spec preparation overlaps them**. Aim to always be at least
two specs ahead of the running engine. If you run out of specs to write, wait for the notification
rather than launching anything.

---

## Steps

### 1. Parse the chain
Resolve `$ARGUMENTS` to an ordered list. For a lane-file path, read the JSON, validate it against
`.claude/workflows/lane.schema.json` at a glance (required top-level keys `lane`, `roadmap`,
`blocks`), and take the `id` of each entry in `blocks[]` in array order — **array order IS chain
order**; there is no comment syntax or line order to strip, because the file is structured data,
not a directive list. A per-block briefing that used to live as lane-file prose now lives on the
block's own record (`notes`/`why`); read it there, not from this file. Print the chain with
positions so the operator can confirm the order before anything runs.

### 2. Check readiness against the live graph
For each block, find it in the repo's `planning/state.json` `tracks[].blocks[]` and resolve every
`depends_on` target's `status`:
- Unmet dependency **inside this chain but later in it** → stop. The order is wrong; report the
  correct order.
- Unmet dependency **outside this chain** → mark `HELD`, drop from this run, and say so plainly:
  *"HELD: `<id>` needs `<dep>` (`<repo>`) — run after that lands."* Never silently skip.
- Already `closed` → drop with a note.
- Block belongs to another repo → stop. It is a different lane.

### 3. Resolve block IDs to spec slugs
The spec lives at `planning/<spec-slug>/tasks.md`. Read `planning/` to learn the repo's actual
convention rather than assuming:
- `XX.ticket.<slug>` → `ticket-<slug>` · `XX.chore.<slug>` → `chore-<slug>`
- `XX.<phase>.<letter>` → the master-plan slug, usually `<phase>.<letter>-<kebab-title>`

If a directory already matches, use it verbatim. If you cannot resolve a slug confidently, **stop
and ask** — a wrong slug writes a spec to the wrong place.

### 4. Prepare the first spec, then start the pipeline
If `planning/<spec-slug>/tasks.md` is missing for block 1, run **`/generate-tasks <spec-slug>`**
(or `--from <plan-path> phaseN-blockX` for a standalone plan file). Capture from its output:
- whether it flagged any task as a **`/breakdown` candidate**, and
- its **pipeline recommendation** (its step 11).

Run **`/breakdown planning/<spec-slug>/tasks.md`** *only* when it flagged that spec. Never break
down on your own judgment — an unnecessary breakdown multiplies engine runs for no benefit.

**Two authoring-time rules for any spec or OKF frontmatter this step (or `/generate-tasks`,
or hand-editing) produces or edits** — generalized from a lane that hit both in one day: a
`related:` target must resolve to a real `doc_id` on a document that has actually been crawled,
never a carryover slug or an invented id — an unresolved edge red-gates the whole corpus for
every concurrent lane when `--graph` gates, not just the authoring one. A cross-repo target must
be qualified `<repo>:<doc_id>` (e.g. `base-template:D48-downstream-harness-sync-script`); a bare
`doc_id` resolves only within the authoring repo and is treated as unresolved everywhere else —
see `docs/okf-frontmatter.md` for the full syntax. And a `validation_command` must be scoped to
the task's own changes, never the whole working tree (e.g. never a working-tree-wide `git diff |
grep` guard) — a tree-wide guard can never pass in a shared index with concurrent lanes and bails
the block on an unrelated lane's uncommitted files.

### 5. Decide engine and isolation

**Engine** — take `/generate-tasks`' recommendation unless you have a concrete reason not to:
- **`sdlc-task <spec-slug>`** — one small unit of behaviour change (a `/ticket` or `/chore`
  output, a handful of files). Cheapest rung. In place, no review, no PR.
- **`sdlc-flow <spec-slug>`** — a whole spec wanting a consolidated review, a docs pass, and a PR.
  The default for anything not clearly small.
- Recommends anything else → stop and report (rule 2).

**Isolation.** Both engines default to plain-branch/in-place; `--worktree` opts into an isolated
sparse-checkout worktree. Worktrees are **safe in brain-vaulted repos** — the engines detect a
symlinked `planning/` and resolve it (D46), and `/init-worktree` was fixed to match
(`BT.ticket.init-worktree-symlink-repair`, closed). Plain branch is simply *cheaper*, not safer.

`--worktree` was suspended fleet-wide from 2026-08-23 to 2026-08-28 (`D81-worktree-moratorium`);
it was lifted after `BT.ticket.worktree-smoke-fixture` verified a real `--worktree` run end to end,
so isolation is a per-run choice again. The table below records the current answer.

**Two repos have a non-negotiable answer. Encode them, do not re-derive them per run:**

| Repo | Isolation | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `base-template` | **`--no-worktree`** (default) | The Workflow harness executes a launch-time **copy** of the engine, so a chain editing `.claude/workflows/sdlc-*.js` does not change the engine already executing it, in either isolation mode — a worktree never protected a running chain. The residual exposure is narrower and *between* blocks, not within one: a block's engine edit lands in the working tree before the *next* block's launch snapshots it. Mitigate by sequencing engine edits to a chain boundary, not with `--worktree`. |
| the brain root (HQ) | **`--no-worktree` ALWAYS** | Carryover `hq-specs-cannot-run-in-a-worktree`. Measured 2026-08-04 inside a real branch worktree: `validate-brain --structure` gave **64 errors** and `--state` **601**, against 0/0 in the main tree. `validate-brain` walks up to the worktree's own `brain.toml` and resolves the 17 sub-repos relative to it — and every sub-repo is gitignored, so absent from any checkout. Worktree creation itself is clean; it is specifically the corpus gates that cannot pass. Same root cause as the CI exclusion in D65. |

`--worktree` / `--no-worktree` on the command line overrides all of the above **except those two** —
if a flag contradicts the table, stop and report rather than running a chain whose gates cannot pass.

**Concurrency across sessions is enforced mechanically, not by human memory.** Rule 3 governs one
repo; nothing stops four sessions launching `playwright` and `next build` simultaneously on their
own. `scripts/fleet_concurrency_check.py` lives in the `base-template` checkout (the fleet's shared
harness source, typically a sibling directory at the brain root, e.g. `../base-template` — resolve
its actual path for this machine rather than assuming). Heavy repos are capped **per category, not
fleet-wide** (D66): browser-automation (Playwright, `next build`, ...) and native-build
(`cargo build --release`) draw from separate pools, since browser-automation tooling stays
CPU-expensive for a lane's whole run while a native build is only expensive once per lane, at the
end/reconcile. Before starting a heavy repo, determine this by reading the target repo's own
`planning/harness.json`, never from memory:
`python3 <path-to-base-template>/scripts/fleet_concurrency_check.py is-heavy --repo-path <target-repo>`
(the JSON `category` field is `"browser-automation"` or `"native-build"`), then register it with
that category:
`python3 <path-to-base-template>/scripts/fleet_concurrency_check.py register --repo <name> --category <category> --agent <this lane's agent identity>`.
Exit code `3` (or `"allowed": false` in the JSON output) means either that category's pool is already at
capacity (`MAX_LANES_BY_CATEGORY`: 2 browser-automation, 4 native-build) **or** that a held exclusive lease
is blocking this registration — the two are distinguishable from the JSON output's now-populated
`exclusive_leases` array (non-empty means a lease, not capacity, is the cause) versus `active`. Either
way: put this repo on a cheap-gate block instead, or wait.

**Do not pass `--pid`.** The process running `register` is the short-lived Claude Code command
invocation itself — it exits as soon as this step returns, so its own pid is never a valid
liveness signal for a later process to check. Leave `pid_source` at its default (`"self"`); the
entry is then held by **TTL (90 minutes) plus explicit release only**, never by pid liveness.
**Pass `--agent <this lane's agent identity>`** on every `register` and `release` call — the
entry is keyed on that identity, not on the caller's pid, which is what lets a `release` run
from a different process than the one that registered actually free the slot. If a heavy chain
runs longer than that, re-register periodically as a heartbeat (`... register --repo <name>
--category <category> --agent <this lane's agent identity>` again): a repeat register for the
SAME agent refreshes `started_at` on the existing entry in place rather than consuming a second
slot.

**The old release → register → re-take workaround is superseded by this heartbeat.** Before the entry
was keyed on `--agent`, refreshing a long-running heavy lane's slot meant `release` followed by a
fresh `register` — which really did give the slot up and let another lane claim it mid-chain. Do
not do that any more: repeat the `register` in place. (The *repo lease* release/drain/re-take at
the block boundary in rule 10 and step 10 is a different mechanism and is still required.)

**The lane MUST release its slot on exit** — success, failure, or abandonment — with
`... release --repo <name> --agent <this lane's agent identity>` when the heavy repo's chain
finishes. A stale entry (one past the TTL,
or one with an *explicitly*-supplied `--pid` that has died) is swept automatically on the next
registration, so a lane that dies without releasing does not block the fleet permanently — but
release on exit is still required, since TTL is the fallback, not the norm. If the lock store
itself is unavailable (no brain root found, unwritable), the script reports `"degraded": true,
"allowed": true` — same as today's unenforced-prose behavior, not a new way to fail. See
`planning/decisions/D61-fleet-concurrency-enforcement.md` and
`planning/decisions/D66-tiered-heavy-lane-concurrency.md` for the full design.

**Fleet-exclusive lanes (`exclusive_repos`).** If the lane record's `exclusive_repos` array is
non-empty, before the first block starts, write an additional `kind: exclusive` lease at
`<lock_dir>/leases/lease-<repo>.json` for **each** repo named in `exclusive_repos` — same shape as
any other lease record (`repo`, `lane`, `agent`, `acquired_at`, `kind: exclusive`; no new field).
While any such lease is held, every other agent's `fleet_concurrency_check.py register` call is
refused with exit `3` regardless of category or heaviness, so a lane that must run with the fleet
quiesced can actually hold it — this is admission control only, never pre-emption of a lane
already running. Remove every lease written this way at lane close — success, failure, or
abandonment — alongside the ordinary lease and registry releases. `exclusive_repos` is read only
here; no new field is added to `.claude/workflows/lane.schema.json` or to the lease record.

### 6. Launch the engine — do not wait idly
Invoke the workflow **in this session**:
- `sdlc-task <spec-slug> [--worktree]`
- `sdlc-flow <spec-slug> --auto-merge [--worktree]` — prefer `--auto-merge` in a chain so an open
  PR does not block the next block. Drop it when the change deserves a look first.

It returns a task ID immediately. **Check the script path in the launch result before going on** —
the `Workflow` tool inherits the session cwd, so an engine launched from the wrong tree silently
runs against another repo's `.claude/workflows/`. The path must name the repo you intend to drive;
if it does not, stop the launch rather than letting the engine proceed.

**Now go back to step 4 for the next un-specced blocks** and keep
generating specs until either the notification arrives or you are out of blocks to prepare.

### 7. On the completion notification
If the engine **bailed** (triage MAJOR, immediate-bail, review FAIL after its bounded retries):
- `--stop-on-fail` (default) → stop the chain. Report which block, why, and the remaining chain.
- `--continue-on-fail` → record it, leave the block `open`, continue. **Never mark a bailed block
  closed.**

**Record the bail in the run-state's `bails[]` shape (BT.ticket.bails-must-be-append-only).** An
engine-driven bail already appends this entry to the spec's `sdlc-*state.json` itself; a
hand-driven bail — one this chain records from a lane's report rather than from a live engine
invocation — must produce the same append so the two are indistinguishable on disk later. APPEND
(never overwrite) an entry shaped:
```
{occurred_at, task_id, check_id, failing_artifact, ownership, bail_class, reason, resolution: null}
```
- `occurred_at` — ISO-8601 timestamp of the bail, not of when you're writing this entry after.
- `task_id` — the task the engine was on when it bailed.
- `check_id` — the harness check name from the failure output, if the report names one; `null`
  otherwise.
- `failing_artifact` — the path the check named in its failure output, or `null` when it named
  none. Never fabricate a path the report didn't give you.
- `ownership` — `self` when `failing_artifact` intersects the task's declared `files[]`, `foreign`
  when it does not — the same set-intersection `renderWorkAssertion()` already computes; `null`
  when `failing_artifact` is `null`.
- `bail_class` — the immediate-bail reason number if the report gives one, else `null`.
- `reason` — the human-readable bail reason (mirrors what would otherwise have gone into
  `bail_reason`).
- `resolution` — `null` at record time; filled in later (`resumed-clean`, `respec`, or
  `abandoned`) on whichever run clears the bail — never delete or overwrite the original entry to
  do so.
Load the `record-a-bail` skill for the classification vocabulary (artifact-vs-detector, same-vs-
different defect) before deciding `check_id`/`failing_artifact`/`bail_class` for a report that
doesn't spell them out directly.

If the engine did **not** bail but `sdlc-flow`'s return has `stranded: true` — a `PASS` verdict
that ended with no PR opened and (under `--auto-merge`) no merge, because the PR stage was
attempted and either errored or could not be independently verified via `gh pr view` — **treat it
the same as a bail for chain purposes**: it is a completed-looking run whose work never actually
landed anywhere the next block can build on.
- `--stop-on-fail` (default) → stop the chain. Report the block, `prOutcome` (`'failed'`) and
  `state.pr`/the branch name so the operator can open the PR manually, and the remaining chain.
- `--continue-on-fail` → record it, leave the block `open`, continue — same as a bail. **Never
  treat a `stranded: true` run as integrated;** the next block would be building on a base missing
  this one's work.
- `prOutcome: 'impossible'` (no `gh` / no remote) is **not** `stranded` and needs no special
  handling here — that is the standalone-repo degradation path working as intended; the branch is
  intact and ready for a manual PR whenever the operator wants one.

### 8. Integrate, then verify the state write

**Integrate:**
- In-place `sdlc-task` → nothing to merge.
- `sdlc-flow --auto-merge` → confirm the PR actually merged and the branch is gone.
- `sdlc-flow` without it → merge the PR, then delete the branch.
- Any `--worktree` run → **`/clean-worktree <spec-slug>`** (or the literal worktree name the engine
  printed, including any `-2`/`-3` suffix).
- **Merge conflicts are yours.** Resolve toward the incoming block's intent, re-run the gating
  suite, and record what you resolved. If two blocks genuinely disagree about the same behaviour,
  stop the chain and report — even under `--continue-on-fail`.

**Verify the state write — never skip this** (rule 5). Check:
- `planning/state.json` → the block's `status` is `closed`
- `planning/<spec-slug>/tasks.md` → checkboxes match what ran
- `planning/status.md` → regenerated, not stale

If any is wrong: set `status` to `closed`, then run **`mev emit-state --write`** and
**`mev validate-brain --state`** (expect 0 errors). **Record every repair** — a pattern of them is
evidence for that open ticket.

**Then check the corpus, then commit, then report** (rules 7, 8 and 9). Run the four read-only
checks, **one invocation per flag** — `validate-brain`'s flags do not compose (`main.rs` is an
if/else-if chain, first flag wins; passing more than one silently runs only the highest-precedence
one and reports a real, passing result for a check that never ran):

```
bastion validate-brain --state
bastion validate-brain --graph
bastion validate-brain --links
bastion validate-brain --structure
```

`./scripts/sync/validate_brain.sh` is **not** this check — on a `primary` host it ends in an
`emit-state --write`, a commit, and a `git push` (see `derive-state-safely`), so a lane using it as
its closing verification is committing and pushing whatever the shared index holds, not just its
own work.

**Note the `sync/`.** There is no `./scripts/validate_brain.sh` — that path exits **127**, which
reads as a failed corpus gate rather than a missing file, so a lane that copies it concludes the
fleet is red. Measured 2026-08-28: four lanes hit this in one night, and one then reached for the
path that does exist and ran the writer as its closing check.

Concurrent lanes pushing into one corpus is exactly the condition that accumulated 32
`validate-brain` errors across four lanes on 2026-08-04 and blocked `git push` fleet-wide. Rule 6
checks downstream *code* consumers; nothing else checks the *corpus*, so this belongs here.

Commit the `state.json` and its regenerated surfaces as their own commit, then append **both** the
lane-log line and this block's `planning/orchestration-run/<roadmap-slug>/notes.md` entries (rule 9
— including any decision you took under rule 11) and commit those together. **Only then** launch
the next engine.

> **`planning/state.json` is written with `ensure_ascii=False`.** If you edit it with a script,
> round-trip with `json.dump(..., indent=2, ensure_ascii=False)` plus a trailing newline. Using the
> default `ensure_ascii=True` escapes every em dash and turns a 3-field edit into ~130 lines of
> churn — which becomes a conflict for every sibling lane.

### 9. Check downstream consumers — only for blocks that touched a shared crate's public types

A lane cannot see the sibling lanes running in other repos. Twice now that has caused a real
cross-repo break mid-run: okf-core's `OK.3.B` added a non-`Option` field to six shared structs and
broke both `mev` (101 sites) and `bastion` (31 sites) in test code that `cargo build` cannot see;
mev's D58 removed a public constant and broke `engine-rs`'s workspace compile. This step exists to
catch that class **before** the next block in a *different* lane hits it, not to police every
block in this one.

**Fires only when** the block just integrated changed a public type, field, or removed/renamed a
public symbol in a crate other repos depend on via a `path = "../..."` Cargo dependency (e.g.
`okf-core`, `mev`, `engine-rs`'s `engine-contract`, `claude-code-rs`). Skip silently for
non-Rust blocks, blocks with no public-surface change, and blocks in a repo nothing else path-depends
on — the cost is a cold build per consumer, so do not run it for every block.

Find consumers by grepping the fleet for `path = "../<this-repo>"` (or the specific crate name) in
every other repo's `Cargo.toml`. For each one found:

```
git -C <consumer> status --porcelain          # non-empty → SKIP, report SKIPPED-DIRTY
CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$(mktemp -d) cargo nextest run --no-run --locked \
    --manifest-path <consumer>/Cargo.toml
```

Each flag earns its place — do not simplify this away:
- **`--locked`** — refuses to rewrite the consumer's `Cargo.lock`, turning a silent mutation into a
  useful error instead of leaving an uncommitted diff in a repo you don't own. This exact mutation
  happened during manual verification on 2026-08-04.
- **`CARGO_TARGET_DIR=$(mktemp -d)`** — no `target/` lock contention with whatever else might be
  building in that repo, no incremental-cache churn. Costs a cold build; that is the price of not
  interfering.
- **dirty check first** — never blame your shared-crate change for someone else's half-written
  code; a dirty consumer is not evidence of anything.
- **`cargo nextest run --no-run`, never `cargo build`, never plain `cargo test`** — the entire
  `E0063` class (missing struct fields) is invisible to `build`; only test code constructs the
  affected literals, so a compile-only test build is still required. Plain `cargo test` is
  **denied fleet-wide by a `PreToolUse` hook** — see `core/mev/.claude/settings.json`, which
  matches `cargo\s+test(\s|$)` on any Bash command and returns `permissionDecision: deny` unless
  the command contains `cargo nextest` or is prefixed `NEXTEST_POLICY_OVERRIDE=1`.
  `cargo nextest run --no-run` compiles the same test targets and is not denied.

**Report only. Never fix another lane's repo** and never run this against a repo with an active
worktree lane of its own — a plain `cargo build`/`cargo nextest run` in a repo mid-chain can mutate
its `Cargo.lock` out from under that lane. If a consumer fails, add it to the final report as a new
**BROKEN DOWNSTREAM** line (repo, error class, one-line fix estimate) — do not open a fix block for
it yourself; that is the operator's call, same as a `HELD` block.

**Concurrent cargo runs in sibling repos can contaminate captured output.** Observed once during
the audit: a `mev` build capture returned `engine-rs`'s test summary — another lane's build was
writing to the terminal or a shared capture at the same time. A surprising result (an unexpected
PASS or an unexpected failure class) from this step is not trustworthy on its own when other lanes
are active concurrently. Mitigation: if the result looks surprising, re-run the capture in
isolation (no other lane's cargo command in flight) before reporting it as **BROKEN DOWNSTREAM** or
as a clean pass.

### 10. Re-check the next block's dependencies, then launch it
Cheap, and it catches anything that changed outside the chain.

**This is the block boundary — release the lease, drain the inbox, re-take the lease, and
re-stamp both heartbeats** (rule 10): before releasing, re-stamp the registry claim's `heartbeat`
(`<lock_dir>/lane-agents/agent-<agent_name>.json`) — and, if the claim carries the optional
`current_block`/`block_started_at` fields, re-stamp those too, to the next block's id and now,
in the same write; release
`<lock_dir>/leases/lease-<repo>.json`; drain `<lock_dir>/queue/<repo>/<lane>/` via
`drain_queue()`/`complete_message()`; re-take the lease and re-stamp its `heartbeat` before
launching the next engine. Leave `started_at` and `acquired_at` untouched — see rule 10. If
`--stop-after` has been reached, or `--autonomy` says this is a stopping point, release the lease
and registry claim as at lane close and stop here instead of continuing to step 6. Otherwise
return to step 6.

### 11. Repeat until the chain is done or stopped.

---

## Traps

- `rg`/`find` are symlink-blind and every `planning/` is a symlink into a `_planning/` vault — pass
  `-L`. At the brain root every sub-repo is also **gitignored**, so `-L` alone still skips them all
  — pass `-uu` too. A sweep reporting "clean" without both is not trustworthy. See
  `begin-orchestration.md`'s Traps section for the same rule stated for that command. **`-uu` also
  disables `.gitignore`'s protection against `target/`/`node_modules/`, so pair it with
  `--glob '!**/target/**' --glob '!**/node_modules/**' --glob '!**/.git/**'`** — this fleet's ~43GB
  of Rust `target/` dirs otherwise get walked, pegging 350–500% CPU for minutes or hitting a Bash
  timeout that reads as a hang, not a slow search.

## Required deliverable — the terminal `review.md`

Before you report, write `planning/orchestration-run/<roadmap-slug>/review.md`. **Required, not
optional.** Plain-English summary of what this chain changed, plus the hand-verification recipes an
operator would run to confirm it. **Every recipe must have been executed by this session before the
file is written, and the file must say so** (e.g. "ran, output: ..."). An authored-but-unrun recipe
reads as verification while being a guess — worse than no recipe. Naming, frontmatter and lifecycle
follow `planning/decisions/D57-orchestration-run-artifact-contract.md`; do not restate it.

## Final report

**<= 20 lines.** Everything else is already on disk — link paths, never restate them. See the
`report-to-the-operator` skill.

Line 1: `<n>/<m> blocks closed[, <k> HELD]` + whether anything needs the operator.

Then a table, one row per block: `# · block ID · engine · outcome · state (clean/repaired) ·
commit or PR`.

Then **only the lines that are non-empty**, one line each:
- **HELD** — block + what it waits on.
- **State repairs** — block + what was wrong.
- **Merge conflicts** — block + how resolved.
- **BROKEN DOWNSTREAM** — repo + error class. Say "none" explicitly; silence is ambiguous here.
- **Needs your call** — anything you could not decide.
- **Remaining chain** — a paste-ready `/orchestrate` invocation, if you stopped early.

Close with the `notes.md` and `review.md` paths, and a one-line `/log-work` reminder (`sdlc-task`'s
bookkeep writes no `log.md` entry).

Decisions and open items go **in `notes.md`**, not in this reply. Name the count and the path.

## Notes

- **This command does not decide what to work on.** Order comes from the operator or the roadmap;
  readiness comes from the `depends_on` graph. If the order looks wrong, say so — do not silently
  reorder.
- **The generated board is the authority on readiness**, not any hand-written wave table. A block
  showing `blocked` in `planning/status.md` is not startable, whatever a roadmap says.
- **Lanes only interact through cross-repo `depends_on` edges**, which step 2 already checks. Run up
  to four repos at once.
