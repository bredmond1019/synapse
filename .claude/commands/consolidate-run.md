title: consolidate-run — Gather orchestration-run records across the fleet and propose carryover entries
description: Discovers per-(repo x roadmap) orchestration-run records for one roadmap, cross-checks them against lane-log.jsonl, selects on D57's two-axis origin_roadmap rule, proposes carryover[] entries with finding_id for mev's cross-repo correlation, and promotes each run's verification-ledger entries into the master test catalogue. Writes no state.json.

# Consolidate Run — gather findings across the fleet for one roadmap

Lane runs leave findings in their own repos (`planning/orchestration-run/<roadmap-slug>/notes.md` and
`review.md`, per [D57](../../planning/decisions/D57-orchestration-run-artifact-contract.md)) and
nothing gathers them. A defect observed once in four separate repos is four notes nobody correlates.
This command implements **D57 section 5** — it gathers, correlates by `finding_id`, and proposes; it
does not decide, and it does not write state.

**It gathers two different things.** The prose records (`notes.md`, `review.md`) carry *what went
wrong* and become proposed `carryover[]` entries (Step 5). The `verification-ledger.json` beside them
carries *what now works and how to check it*, and becomes entries in the fleet's master test
catalogue (Step 5b). Both were being left on disk: the ledgers had never been consolidated at all
until 2026-09-05, when nine of them holding 152 entries were found across six repos.

## Where to run it

**A fresh session at the brain root, on Opus.** It reads across every repo for one roadmap and holds
them in view together; that correlation is the job, and it degrades if the context is already full.

**Do not `/prime` first.** This command assembles its own input set in Step 3 from explicit paths —
priming spends a large part of the window on orientation it will not use. The one exception is
`planning/handoff.md`: if it exists, read that one file, because it is the previous session's
unfinished business and it is cheap.

The disposal half runs in a **different** session again — see
[`/dispose-run`](dispose-run.md)'s own session note for why that separation is load-bearing rather
than incidental.

**Related:** the record contract itself (layout, frontmatter, `origin_roadmap`, `lifecycle`) is
`BT.ticket.orchestration-run-record-contract` — this command depends on it and does not restate it.
`/generate-roadmap --from <consolidated>` is the disposal path for what this command proposes.


**Before writing down anything that is wrong, follow
[`.claude/workflows/finding-discipline.md`](../workflows/finding-discipline.md).** Evidence travels
with the finding or the finding does not exist; one occurrence is an instance, not a pattern; and an
odd-but-unexplained thing is recorded as an **observation** rather than inflated into a defect. The
cut list is part of the report — a pass that files everything it noticed has not filtered. Measured:
three independent audits found 32%/32%/26% of filed carryover already dead.

## Variables

`$ARGUMENTS` — a roadmap slug, plus optional flags.

```
Usage: /consolidate-run <roadmap-slug> [--repo <slug>]
```

| Flag | Required | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<roadmap-slug>` | **yes** | — | The roadmap whose records to consolidate. Matches the `roadmap:` frontmatter field on run records and resolves to `<roadmap-dir>` under `planning/roadmaps/` (or legacy `planning/`) per Step 1's resolution rule. |
| `--repo <slug>` | no | none (fleet-wide) | Scope discovery to one repo instead of the whole fleet. |

**Both scopes required by D57 section 5:**

- **Run at the brain root with no `--repo`** — consolidates the whole roadmap across every repo in
  the fleet. This is the normal case: the point of consolidation is cross-repo correlation.
- **Run inside one repo (or at the brain root with `--repo <slug>`)** — consolidates that repo's
  records for the roadmap alone. Useful when a single lane needs its own findings reviewed before the
  fleet-wide run, or when only one repo's records exist yet.

Empty `$ARGUMENTS` → print usage and stop.

## Not this: several roadmaps at once

This command is **one roadmap**, and its output is proposed `carryover[]` entries for it. To mine
several runs together for the mechanisms behind them — engine defects, orchestration friction,
carryover shapes that recur across repos — use [`/consolidate-fleet`](consolidate-fleet.md), which
invokes this command per roadmap and adds a cross-run pass on top. It also carries the
`lane-log.jsonl` watermark (`scripts/lane_log_watermark.py`), which is what lets a later run resume
from where the last one stopped reading. This command's own resume mechanism is the
`lifecycle: consolidated` stamp of Step 6 and is unchanged.

## Step 1 — Resolve scope

Walk up from cwd for `brain.toml` to find `BRAIN_ROOT`. Resolve `<roadmap-slug>` to `roadmap_dir` via
`/begin-orchestration`'s Step 1C rule (`planning/roadmaps/<roadmap-slug>/` first, then legacy
`planning/<roadmap-slug>/`; both existing is an error) — cited here, not restated. If neither
location exists, stop — there is nothing to consolidate into.

If `--repo <slug>` is given, or the command is invoked from inside a sub-repo (cwd is not
`BRAIN_ROOT`), scope every step below to that one repo. Otherwise scope to the whole fleet.

## Step 2 — Participants: `lane-log.jsonl`, cross-checked against the filesystem

**Participants come from `<roadmap-dir>/lane-log.jsonl`** (append-only, one line per integrated
block, each line carrying its `repo` — see `.claude/commands/generate-roadmap.md` and
`begin-orchestration.md`'s `--log` variable, default `<roadmap-dir>/lane-log.jsonl`). Read every
line; the set of distinct `repo` values is the participant list.

**The filesystem sweep (Step 3) is a cross-check, never a silent union.** Compare the participant
list against the set of repos actually holding a discovered run record for this roadmap, in both
directions:

- **A repo wrote a run record but logged no block in `lane-log.jsonl`.** Report it — the lane ran
  outside `/begin-orchestration`'s bookkeeping, or the log write was missed. Do not silently add it
  to the participant list.
- **A repo logged an integrated block but wrote no run record.** Report it — the record write was
  missed, or the lane never reached the notes step. Do not silently drop it from the participant
  list.

Both mismatches go into the consolidated output as findings about the *process*, distinct from the
findings the run records themselves contain.

## Step 3 — Discovery: realpath dedup, `-L` and `-uu`

Sweep `**/orchestration-run/<roadmap-slug>/*.md` from `BRAIN_ROOT` (or from the single repo root when
`--repo` scopes the run). The sweep must pass **both**:

- **`-L`** (follow symlinks) — every repo's `planning/` is a symlink into the vault, including
  inside worktrees. Without `-L` the sweep silently returns nothing for every repo.
- **`-uu`** (search hidden/gitignored paths) — at the brain root, every sub-repo is gitignored from
  the brain's own perspective. `-L` alone silently misses whole repos. **Always pair `-uu` with
  `--glob '!**/target/**' --glob '!**/node_modules/**' --glob '!**/.git/**'`** — `-uu` disables
  `.gitignore`'s protection, and walking this fleet's ~43GB of Rust `target/` dirs pegs 350–500%
  CPU for minutes or hits a Bash timeout that reads as a hang, not a slow search.

**Dedup by `realpath`, before reading.** The same physical file is reachable through more than one
symlink chain: a repo's own `planning/` symlink, and — inside a worktree — a *second* symlink chain
that canonicalizes onto the same vault file, e.g.
`core/engine-rs/trees/sdlc/mev/planning/orchestration-run/notes.md` canonicalizes onto
`core/mev/planning/orchestration-run/notes.md`. Deduping by path string instead of `realpath` **triple-
counts the same finding and, worse, can read a stale worktree copy** instead of the vault original —
a worktree branch that has since been abandoned or superseded still shows up as if it were live. Take
the realpath as the retained path in every case; discard the worktree-routed alias.

**Measured on the ledgers, 2026-09-05, because the fan-out is far worse than it looks for `*.md`:**
a `find -L` for `verification-ledger.*` returned **144 paths that were 18 distinct files** — 9 JSON
and 9 markdown. One okf-core ledger alone was reachable by **25** paths, through chains like
`core/bastion/trees/engine-rs/trees/<block>/trees/sdlc/mev/trees/okf-core/planning/...`. Deduping by
path string would have counted every finding in it 25 times.

## Step 4 — Selection: D57 section 3's two-axis rule

Select records for consolidation on **both** axes, per
[D57 section 3](../../planning/decisions/D57-orchestration-run-artifact-contract.md#3--per-block-origin_roadmap)
(cited, not restated):

1. Records whose own `roadmap:` frontmatter equals `<roadmap-slug>` **and** `lifecycle != consolidated`.
2. Items in *any other* record whose ledger row or finding carries `origin_roadmap: <roadmap-slug>` —
   a block adopted into a different roadmap's lane still attributes its findings back to the roadmap
   that owns it.

A record can therefore contribute to a consolidation run even though its own `roadmap:` field points
elsewhere. Skip nothing on axis 2 solely because axis 1 already selected the record's home roadmap —
the two axes are additive, not a fallback pair.

No dedup, similarity matching, priority ranking, or staleness logic belongs in this half of the
command. `mev` already builds cross-repo dedup and ranking; this command consumes it rather than
shipping a second implementation.

## Step 5 — Propose: `finding_id`, the new `carryover[]` shape, and `mev`'s ranking

Emit `<roadmap-dir>/consolidated-review.md`. Shape it as a flat list of one item per proposed
finding — one row per item — so `/generate-roadmap --from <consolidated-review.md>`'s coverage
crosswalk (required whenever `--from` includes an action register, per
`.claude/commands/generate-roadmap.md`) can map each row to where it lands without re-deriving
structure this command already produced. `--from` already accepts an arbitrary source document
(`generate-roadmap.md`); a `consolidated-review.md` is exactly such a source.

**Every proposed entry carries a `finding_id`.** It is a free-form shared string, no registry,
many-to-one by construction — set it identically on every record contributing the same underlying
claim. This is the command's actual contribution: it is what lets `mev`'s `cluster_by_finding_id`
correlate the same claim across repos. Without it there is nothing for `mev` to group on.

**Proposed entries match the NEW `carryover[]` shape** (per D57 Correction 1 — cited, not restated):

- **`priority`** — `0..3`, lower hotter, default P2 when absent. **Cite
  [D43](../../../docs/decisions/D43-cross-domain-priority-graph.md) for the rubric; never paraphrase
  it.** Restating D43's rubric in a command file is exactly how `close-the-loop/orchestrate-prompt.md`
  came to assert the contradictory "P0 = blocks other work" — a divergence nothing caught because
  nothing linked that file back to D43. That competing reading is not a rival scale: D43 names it
  *cross-DAG priority inheritance*, and it ships as `MV.7.A` (`mev/src/brain/emit.rs:607`) —
  **derived, never authored.** If a proposal needs the rubric applied, link to D43 rather than
  quoting its buckets.
- **`blocks[]`** — the edge array. There is no `blocking: bool` field anywhere in a proposed entry — a
  hand-maintained boolean nothing validates is the defect class D57 exists to remove.
- **`clears_when`** — a **typed predicate**, e.g. `{type: block_closed, repo: base-template, id:
  <block>}`, never free text. Free text may surround an item as context; it may never stand in for
  the predicate itself.
- **`finding_id`** — as above.

**Scope boundary — the point of this command.** It implements **no** dedup, similarity matching,
priority ranking, or staleness logic of its own. `mev` is already building all three:
`MV.ticket.carryover-dedup-clusters` (groups by `finding_id`, suggests links for ungrouped entries,
reports per-repo priority divergence) and `MV.ticket.carryover-triage-ranking` (the public ranking
API, re-cutting lanes to BLOCKING / HOT / AGING / STANDING). This command calls `mev carryover` and
consumes its `clusters` / `suggestions` / `single_repo_finding_ids` sections and its ranking output —
it never recomputes them. This follows the fleet's standing discipline, **"mev owns the derivation;
bastion projects it,"** with the precedent enforced in a doc comment at
`core/bastion/src/serve/handlers/attention.rs:140-141`: *"this function never reimplements that
predicate."* This command is a third projector, not a second deriver.

**Never auto-merges.** The matcher `mev` runs only *suggests* links between findings; this command
never merges two proposed entries into one on its own authority. A false merge destroys durable
knowledge the same way a false `cleared` does.

**Per-repo priority divergence is preserved.** The same claim can be genuinely P0 in one repo (it
blocks revenue there now) and P2 in another (it is routine there). Dedup merges the *claim* — via
shared `finding_id` — and keeps each repo's own `priority` value; it never collapses them to one
number.

## Step 5b — The verification ledgers: promote, or record why not

> **This step is now also invoked by `/consolidate-fleet` Step 5c, which is the normal entry point.**
> `/consolidate-fleet` cites this section rather than copying it, so this remains the single home for
> *how* to judge each entry; what moved there is *when* it runs. Do not duplicate these rules into
> that command — the reason this step existed but did not run for two roadmaps on 2026-09-07 was that
> it lived only under a command nobody invokes any more.


Every run leaves a `verification-ledger.json` beside its `notes.md` — one entry per capability the
run shipped, with a recipe for checking it (the contract is
[`docs/sandbox/run-verification-ledger-prompt.md`](../../../docs/sandbox/run-verification-ledger-prompt.md)).
Those entries are the run's answer to *"what can now be tested that could not be before"*, and until
this step existed nothing ever collected them: on 2026-09-05 nine ledgers holding **152 entries**
across six repos were found unconsolidated, the oldest two days old.

**Make one call per entry.** The question is not "is this good work" — it shipped, it is. The
question is **does this belong in the fleet's permanent test list**:

| `scope` | The entry describes | Goes to |
|---|---|---|
| `fleet` | a durable surface — a registered `harness.json` check, a CLI verb or flag, a schema another repo reads, an engine behaviour, a documented instruction agents follow, a guard against a recurring mistake | [`docs/sandbox/test-catalogue.json`](../../../docs/sandbox/test-catalogue.json) |
| `run-local` | a one-time state change — a data migration, a repair of one record, documentation prose with no code seam, or proof that one specific bug is fixed (that belongs in `remediation.json`) | [`test-catalogue-run-local.json`](../../../docs/sandbox/test-catalogue-run-local.json), with the reason |

**The test for `fleet`: if this broke silently in six weeks, would anyone want to know?**

**`call_site: NONE` does not settle it, and the two cases are opposite.** NONE because the entry is
documentation is `run-local`. NONE because a real seam shipped with **no production caller** is a
`fleet` entry *and a finding* — set `finding: true` and say why. That is the defect class the ledger
contract was built for: code and its tests land, the block closes green, and the caller is never
written. Measured across the first nine ledgers: **7 entries were findings of exactly this shape**,
five of them in one repo, including a nine-kind serde seam with zero consumers.

**Judge the recipe while you are there.** `how_to_verify` must be runnable cold by someone with no
context. Mark `recipe_status: not-cold-runnable` with the reason when it is not — measured on the
first pass, **18 of 152 were not**, almost all for the same two causes: a command with no working
directory, and an "inspect the output" step with no assertion. A catalogue of tests nobody can run
is worse than no catalogue, because it reads as coverage.

**Then note what the docs owe.** A `fleet` entry is new functionality, and new functionality that no
doc describes is how a capability becomes folklore. Set `docs: {page, state}` where `state` is
`current` · `stale` · `missing`, naming the doc that should describe it. A `missing` or `stale`
verdict is a finding for Step 5's proposal list like any other — not a separate errand.

**Do not rewrite a ledger entry.** Carry `capability`, `how_to_verify`, `call_site` and the entry's
`block` through verbatim; the catalogue's `origin` records the ledger path, block and roadmap so
provenance survives promotion. **Never rename an `id`** — it is the join key that every environment's
results row and every `remediation` ref points at.

**An id already in the catalogue is a merge, not a skip and not an overwrite.** 47 of the first
pass's ledger ids already existed there from an earlier hand-consolidation; the catalogue row was the
curated one and the ledger row carried the provenance and the finding flag. Enrich, keeping both.
Check whether an id already exists with `python3 scripts/query_test_catalogue.py --id <id>` (from
`BRAIN_ROOT`) rather than reading the whole file.

**Statuses in a ledger are results, not catalogue data.** A ledger's `status`/`last_verified` say
what happened when that lane checked it, in that place. They go to
[`docs/sandbox/results/<env>.json`](../../../docs/sandbox/results/) — never into the catalogue, which
carries no verdicts by design and whose checker rejects those fields outright.

**Validate before finishing:** `python3 scripts/check_test_catalogue.py` from `BRAIN_ROOT`, exit 0.
It is `gates: true` in HQ's `harness.json`, so a malformed write here red-gates every lane.

### Promoting a ledger entry's `remediation` object into HQ's `remediation.json`

A **failing** ledger entry (`status: failed` or `blocked`) may carry an optional run-local
`remediation` object — `{block, opened_at, note}` — per
[`run-verification-ledger-prompt.md`](../../../docs/sandbox/run-verification-ledger-prompt.md)
(cited, not restated). Where one is present, promote it into
[`docs/sandbox/remediation.json`](../../../docs/sandbox/remediation.json):

- **Assign the global `finding` integer.** This step is the **single writer** of that number —
  never the ledger entry itself. `finding` is a required, unique integer pointing at a `### N.`
  heading in HQ's `findings.md`; if a lane could mint its own, every concurrent lane appending a
  numbered heading to that one shared HQ file would be exactly the contention this fleet has
  already been bitten by repeatedly (CLAUDE.md standing rule 10). Deferring the number to this one
  consolidating writer is the whole point of keeping the ledger-side object un-numbered.
- **Write `coverage: [{test_id, env}]`** from the ledger entry's own `id`/`env` (the test_id must
  already resolve in `test-catalogue.json` — promote the ledger entry there first, per Step 5b
  above, if it is not yet catalogued). Check resolution with
  `python3 scripts/query_test_catalogue.py --id <id>` (from `BRAIN_ROOT`) rather than reading the
  whole file.
- **Set `status`** to `filed` when the `remediation.block` is still OPEN in that repo's
  `planning/state.json`, and `fixed` when it is CLOSED. `status: filed` has never been used across
  the existing entries, and `scripts/check_remediation.py` check 7 only demands a *closed* block
  for `fixed` — it imposes nothing on `filed` — so `filed` against an open block is a valid,
  gate-passing state, not a special case to work around.
- **Add the reverse link**: the matching `test-catalogue.json` entry's `remediation` list must name
  the new remediation id (check 10 validates this both ways). Find that entry with
  `python3 scripts/query_test_catalogue.py --id <id>` (from `BRAIN_ROOT`) rather than reading the
  whole file.
- Carry `remediation.note` into the new entry's `issue`, and `remediation.opened_at` forward
  verbatim; do not invent a `verify` recipe beyond what the ledger entry's own `how_to_verify`
  already gives.

Do not alter `scripts/check_remediation.py`'s ten checks, `remediation.json`'s schema, or
`findings.md`'s numbering scheme — this step consumes that contract, it does not change it.

**Validate after promoting:** `python3 scripts/check_remediation.py` from `BRAIN_ROOT`, exit 0. It is
`gates: true` in HQ's `harness.json`.

## Step 6 — Write boundary: no `state.json`, anywhere

This command **writes no `state.json` in any repo.** One command writing state across nine repos is
the exact contention pattern that has already cost real runs in this fleet (CLAUDE.md standing rule
10) — write authority stays narrow by design (D57 OD-4). It proposes; `/generate-roadmap --from`
disposes, reusing the existing authoring path instead of creating a second one.

It makes exactly **two** kinds of write, neither of them `state.json`:

1. **`lifecycle: consolidated`** on the run records it consumed, so a re-run does not re-propose the
   same findings.
2. **The test catalogue** — `docs/sandbox/test-catalogue.json` and
   `test-catalogue-run-local.json` (Step 5b), plus the ledger's own verdicts appended to
   `docs/sandbox/results/<env>.json`. These are append-mostly and live in HQ, not in any repo's
   `state.json`. **Never rename or delete an existing catalogue id** while doing it: every
   environment's results row and every `remediation` ref joins on that id, so a rename silently
   destroys one environment's history for that test.

It does not touch `carryover[]`, `tracks[]`, or any other `state.json` field in any repo — those
writes belong to whatever consumes `consolidated-review.md`.
