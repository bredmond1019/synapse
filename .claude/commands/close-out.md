# Close Out — Verify test coverage, patch docs, and hand off cleanly.

Run this after `/sdlc-flow` or any implementation session to close the
quality loop before handing off: run the full test suite, fill coverage gaps, patch stale
docs, then produce a clean `/handoff`.

## Variables

$ARGUMENTS — optional. Parsed left to right:
  - `--gap-check-only` — run Steps 1–3 only (validation + coverage + docs); skip Step 4
    (`/handoff`). Designed for automated per-block close-out from a roadmap orchestration run
    where handing off mid-run makes no sense. Preserves all gating and coverage logic.
  - `--skip-coverage` — skip Step 2 (coverage scan + gap fill); use when coverage is
    already known good or was verified by a prior `/sdlc-flow` end review.
  - `--clean-worktree` — run Step 5 (clean-worktree) at the very end to merge a **worktree** branch
    into `main` and remove the worktree. Default is false (do not clean) to protect the "never
    auto-merge" rule.
  - `--merge-branch` — run Step 5b at the very end to merge the current **plain** (non-worktree)
    branch into the base and regenerate derived surfaces (`mev emit-state --write`) on the base. Use
    this for a `/sdlc-flow` run in its default branch mode (no worktree to remove). Default is false.
    Mutually exclusive with `--clean-worktree` (that one handles worktree branches; this one handles
    plain branches).
  - `--base <ref>` — optional. Explicit diff base (branch, tag, or commit-ish) for the Step 1 emoji
    gate and the Step 2a coverage sweep. Overrides the auto-resolution in Step 0.5 entirely — use it
    when that resolution would guess wrong, or when Step 0.5 has nothing to resolve from (no
    `flow.prBase`, no `origin/HEAD`, no local `main`/`master`) and refuses to run.
  - Remaining text — passed through verbatim as the narrative note to `/handoff`. If
    omitted, `/handoff` derives context from git history and status.md.

Examples:
  - (no args) — run all steps; `/handoff` derives the narrative
  - `--gap-check-only` — run Steps 1–3 only; no handoff (used by automated orchestration)
  - `--clean-worktree` — run all steps, and clean/merge the worktree at the end
  - `--merge-branch` — run all steps, and merge the current plain branch into the base + emit-state at the end
  - `--base develop` — scope the gates to `develop` instead of auto-resolving
  - `shipped D36 close-out command` — run all steps; pass note to `/handoff`
  - `--skip-coverage shipped D36` — skip coverage scan; pass note to `/handoff`

## Execution Model

Run inline — do NOT spawn a subagent. `/update-docs`, `write-repo-doc` / `write-operating-doc`, `/handoff`, and `/clean-worktree` are
invoked as Skill tool calls or commands from the main agent context; they have their own confirmation gates.

## Instructions

### Step 0 — Parse $ARGUMENTS

Strip `--gap-check-only` if present (record whether it was set — when set, Step 4 is skipped).
Strip `--skip-coverage` if present (record whether it was set).
Strip `--clean-worktree` if present (record whether it was set).
Strip `--merge-branch` if present (record whether it was set).
Strip `--base <ref>` if present (record the ref value; empty string if not passed).
If BOTH `--clean-worktree` and `--merge-branch` were passed, stop and tell the user they are mutually
exclusive (worktree branch vs plain branch) — pick one.
Treat the remainder as the handoff note (may be empty).

### Step 0.5 — Resolve the diff base for Steps 1 and 2

Both the emoji gate (Step 1) and the coverage sweep (Step 2a) must scope to the **same** base — a
hard-coded two-dot diff against a literal `main` is empty by definition whenever `HEAD` is the base
branch itself (the default state after an in-place run, a plain-branch run, or right after `--auto-merge`/
`--merge-branch` land), which reports a vacuous clean instead of "nothing considered." Resolve the
base **once**, from real evidence, and refuse to proceed if nothing resolves — never fall back to
the literal string `main`. When HEAD is the base with no merge commit, also try recovering the
pre-task `base_sha` an `/sdlc-task` in-place run persisted to its `sdlc-task-state.json` before
refusing — see the script below.

Run this once, substituting the `--base` value parsed in Step 0 for `BASE_ARG` (empty string if
`--base` was not passed):

```bash
BASE_ARG="<value of --base, or empty>"
RESOLVED_BASE=""

if [ -n "$BASE_ARG" ]; then
  if ! git rev-parse --verify "$BASE_ARG" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    echo "CLOSE-OUT: --base '$BASE_ARG' does not resolve to a valid ref. Aborting."; exit 1

```

If this script exits non-zero: **stop. Do not proceed to Step 1.** Surface its message to the user
verbatim — it already states what to do (pass `--base <ref>`, or run from the feature branch).

### Step 1 — Run the validation suite

Read `planning/harness.json`. Run every check listed in `validation.checks[]` in order
(lint, type, test, build). Then always run the universal emoji gate last, scoped to the range
resolved in Step 0.5:

```bash
python3 - "$(cat .git/CLOSE_OUT_RANGE)" <<'PYEOF'
import subprocess, re, sys
RANGE = sys.argv[1]
EMOJI = re.compile(r'[\U0001F300-\U0001FAFF\U00002600-\U000027BF]')
FOOTER = 'Generated with Claude Code'
diff = subprocess.run(['git','diff','-M','-U0', RANGE, '--', '*.md', '*.mdx'], capture_output=True, text=True).stdout.splitlines()
hits = []
cur_file = None
cur_line = None
for line in diff:
    if line.startswith('diff --git '):
        cur_file = None; cur_line = None
    elif line.startswith('+++ '):
        p = line[4:]
        cur_file = None if p == '/dev/null' else (p[2:] if p.startswith('b/') else p)
    elif line.startswith('@@'):
        m = re.match(r'@@ -\d+(?:,\d+)? \+(\d+)(?:,\d+)? @@', line)
        cur_line = int(m.group(1)) if m else None
    elif cur_file and cur_line is not None and line.startswith('+') and not line.startswith('+++'):
        content = line[1:]
        if EMOJI.search(content) and FOOTER not in content:
            hits.append(f'{cur_file}:{cur_line}: {content.rstrip()[:100]}')
        cur_line += 1
if hits:
    print('EMOJI CHECK FAIL:'); [print(h) for h in hits[:25]]; sys.exit(1)
print(f'EMOJI CHECK: OK (diff-scoped added lines only, range={RANGE})'); sys.exit(0)
PYEOF
```

If any **gating** check (`gates: true`) fails, or the emoji gate fails:
- Surface the failure with the exact command and relevant output.
- **Stop. Do not proceed to Steps 2–4.**
- Tell the user: which check failed and what it produced; suggest re-running the spec through
  `/sdlc-task <spec>` (or `/sdlc-flow <spec>`) if a spec is in flight, or direct the failing
  command at the problem.
- Do NOT attempt to fix failures here — this command closes out done work, not in-flight work.

If all gating checks pass (non-gating failures are surfaced but don't block): proceed.

### Step 2 — Coverage gap scan (skip if `--skip-coverage` was passed)

Assess whether recently changed source files have adequate test coverage, and fill blocking
gaps.

**2a — Identify changed source files**

Run `git diff "$(cat .git/CLOSE_OUT_RANGE)" --name-only` — the **same** range Step 1 resolved in
Step 0.5; the coverage sweep must never diverge from the emoji gate's base. Filter to source files
only — exclude: `*.md`, `*.mdx`, `*.json`, `*.toml`, `*.yaml`, `*.yml`, `planning/`, `docs/`,
`scaffold/`.

If no source files changed (docs/config-only session): skip to Step 3 silently.

**2b — Classify each file**

For each changed source file, check whether the changed code paths are exercised by tests:
- Look for a sibling test file (`src/foo.rs` → inline `#[cfg(test)]` block or
  `tests/foo_test.rs`; `lib/foo.ts` → `lib/foo.test.ts` or `__tests__/foo.test.ts`).
- Skim the diff for new public functions, new exported types, new error branches, and new
  command/handler registrations — these are the test targets.

Classify as:
- **Adequate** — changed code is exercised by existing or clearly new tests.
- **Non-blocking gap** — private helper, trivial wrapper, constant, config change, or
  internal-only path with no direct user-observable behavior. Note; don't block.
- **Blocking gap** — new public function, exported type used in a call path, new error
  branch the caller can observe, or new CLI command/handler with zero test coverage.

**2c — Fill blocking gaps**

For each blocking gap:
- Write a minimal, targeted test that exercises the specific function or path. One test
  per gap. Use the project's existing test style (read a neighbor test file to match
  conventions). No mocking unless the code itself requires it.
- If a gap is too ambiguous to test confidently — complex multi-file setup, unclear
  invariant, would require a test harness that doesn't exist yet — **ask the user**:
  "No clear way to test `<symbol>` minimally. Write a skeleton, skip it, or note in
  handoff?" Do not guess; do not write a vacuous test that asserts nothing.

After writing any tests: re-run the gating checks from Step 1 to confirm the new tests
pass. If they fail: fix them before proceeding (you wrote them; they are yours to fix).

Record non-blocking gaps for the handoff note (Step 4).

### Step 3 — Patch documentation

Invoke the `/update-docs --patch` skill. Wait for it to complete. This run's check 5 sweeps
`planning/context.md` (or the project's orientation-router equivalent) for staleness against what
this session actually changed — a new decision, a new `docs/` page, a structural change — and
patches it surgically when it drifts; nothing else in the harness keeps that file current, so this
is the one reliable place it gets fixed. If `/update-docs` reports it `NEEDS_REVIEW` (a genuine
rewrite, not a surgical patch), route it through Step 3b's size table below like any other doc.

#### 3b — Bring every doc you touched up to the current standard

**Governed by D73** (`base-template/planning/decisions/D73-docs-upgrade-incrementally-through-close-out.md`);
the standard itself is D72.

**Load the `write-repo-doc` skill and apply it to each doc this run created or edited.** Most docs
in this fleet predate that standard: they open with prose instead of a quickstart, use vocabulary
they never define, and name commands and scripts without linking them. `/close-out` runs on
virtually every piece of work, which makes it the one reliable place these get fixed — a doc that is
never touched stays as it is, and that is fine.

**Pick the right standard for the doc's job — there are two, and they differ in kind, not degree.**

| The doc is meant to be | Load |
|---|---|
| **understood** — a reference, a guide, an architecture page | `write-repo-doc` |
| **acted on** — an operating rhythm, a checklist, a next-action board, a runbook | `write-operating-doc` |

The operating standard is one screen, tables over prose, at most five things to do, every item a
physical act under 20 minutes, and the argument split out into a `-rationale.md` sibling. Applying
`write-repo-doc` to an operating doc produces a well-structured page nobody can act on — which is
the failure it was written from: a 165-line doc that was correct, complete, and not read.

**Scope, so this does not become a rewrite of the whole repo:** only docs in this run's
`changed`/`created` set. Never sweep `docs/` looking for work.

Judge each one against the skill's checklist. The common gaps:

- No quickstart — the reader must skim prose to find the first command.
- A command or script named but not linked, or named without saying **where it is typed** (a Claude
  Code slash command and a shell command look identical on the page).
- Vocabulary used confidently and defined nowhere.
- A section that opens in jargon with no plain-English sentence first.

**Then route by size — do not start a large rewrite inside a close-out:**

| Situation | Do this |
|---|---|
| Small gaps (a quickstart, a few links, a sentence per section) | **Fix it now**, in this commit. |
| A genuine rewrite, **and this repo is running a roadmap** | File a `/ticket` against that roadmap. Say which doc and which gaps. |
| A genuine rewrite, **and there is no active roadmap** | Add a **`carryover[]` entry** (`kind: drift`) to `planning/state.json`. |
| It blocks something | Only then consider an edge. **This is the last resort, not the default.** |

**Why a carryover rather than a backlog ticket when there is no roadmap:** carryover surfaces on the
Attention board on its own. A backlog ticket with no roadmap driving it has no command that calls it
back up, so it sits unread. Prefer the container that resurfaces itself.

Record what you did either way — fixed in place, ticketed, or carried over — in the Step 4 report.

### Step 4 — Hand off

**Skip this step if `--gap-check-only` was passed.** Instead, print a one-line summary:
`Gap-check complete. Gating: <PASS|FAIL>. Coverage gaps filled: <N>. Docs patched: <yes|no>.`

Otherwise, invoke the `/handoff` skill — **and stay in this command until it has actually
finished.** `/handoff` is not a report you hand back; it is the step that produces this command's
last three artifacts:

| Artifact | Written by |
|---|---|
| `planning/handoff.md` | `/handoff` Step 3 |
| the `log.md` session entry + `status.md` timestamp | `/handoff` Step 4a-4b |
| the commit | `/handoff` Step 4d |

**`/close-out` is not complete until all three exist.** Two nested skills run inside this command
(`/update-docs` in Step 3, `/handoff` here), each ending in its own Report section — do not mistake
either sub-report for the end of `/close-out`. If you are about to write this command's Report and
`log.md` has no entry for this session, you have stopped one step early: go back and finish Step 4.

Pass the handoff note (the $ARGUMENTS remainder after stripping `--skip-coverage`, `--gap-check-only`, `--clean-worktree`, and `--merge-branch`). If non-blocking coverage gaps were found in Step 2, prepend a brief line to the note:

```
Coverage note: <comma-separated list of files with non-blocking gaps> — not blocking.
<original note, if any>
```

### Step 5 — Clean worktree (skip unless `--clean-worktree` was passed)

If `--clean-worktree` was passed:
1. Determine the current git branch name:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
2. If the current branch is `main`, print: "Already on main; skipping worktree cleanup." and skip this step.
3. Otherwise, run the `/clean-worktree` command for the current branch:
   ```
   /clean-worktree <branch-name>
   ```
   *Note: This will merge the branch into main and remove the worktree/branch. By default, close-out does NOT run this cleanup to protect the "never auto-merge" rule; it must be explicitly opted into via `--clean-worktree`.*

### Step 5b — Merge plain branch (skip unless `--merge-branch` was passed)

For a `/sdlc-flow` run in its **default branch mode**, the work lives on a plain branch checked out
in the main working tree — there is no worktree to remove, so `--clean-worktree` does not apply. This
step merges that branch into the base and regenerates derived surfaces, mirroring `/clean-worktree`'s
merge + emit-state steps without the worktree teardown.

If `--merge-branch` was passed:

1. Resolve the base branch (`main` unless `planning/harness.json` `flow.prBase` is set) as `<base>`,
   and the current branch:
   ```bash
   git branch --show-current
   ```
2. If the current branch is already `<base>`, print "Already on base; nothing to merge." and skip.
3. **Show what will merge** (the branch's commits not yet on the base):
   ```bash
   git log --oneline <base>..HEAD
   ```
4. **Merge into the base (fast-forward only):** switch to the base and fast-forward it to the branch.
   ```bash
   git checkout <base>
   git merge --ff-only <branch-name>
   ```
   - **If fast-forward succeeds:** continue to step 5.
   - **If fast-forward fails** (the base advanced since the branch was created): stop, delete nothing,
     print the divergence (`git log --oneline <branch-name>..<base>`) and the resolution options —
     Option A `git merge <branch-name>` (create a merge commit), or Option B rebase the branch onto
     `<base>` then re-run `/close-out --merge-branch`. Leave the branch intact. Do NOT proceed to
     step 5 or 6. (The branch-mode `/sdlc-flow` wrap-up already committed status.md / log.md / the
     amendment log on the branch, so a successful merge carries them onto the base automatically — no
     separate task-log application is needed.)
5. **Regenerate derived surfaces.** The merged branch carries an authored `planning/state.json`
   block-status flip to `"closed"` (the branch-mode wrap-up deferred emit-state because it ran on
   the feature branch, not the base). Now that it has landed on `<base>`, regenerate every derived
   surface from the authored graph — the one-way derivation (`focus`, rollups, cache `synced_from`
   watermarks, tier tables, the HQ Operating Board, `master-plan.md` wave tables).

   If `$BRAIN_ROOT/scripts/sync/emit_state_write.sh` exists (resolve `BRAIN_ROOT` the way `/log-work`
   Step 0 does — walk up for `brain.toml`), run it instead of the bare command: it adds content-loss
   guards and, on success, commits what it wrote **locally only** — push stays opt-in behind an env
   var only a nightly cron sets, so this never pushes on its own. This harness stays project-agnostic,
   so it only checks for the script; it never assumes one exists. Otherwise:
   ```bash
   mev emit-state --write --require-fresh
   ```
   and then **commit the result yourself, locally, before deleting the branch** — this step used to
   leave the regenerated surfaces uncommitted on `<base>` after emit-state ran, which is a real defect
   fixed here: an emit-state run always changes something, and a merge that lands looking clean while
   leaving derived files dirty in the working tree is worse than the merge failing outright.
   ```bash
   git add planning/state.json planning/status.md docs/projects/*.md planning/*/sdlc/*state.json  # the surfaces emit-state touched, PLUS the block's own SDLC run-state — never `git add -A`
   git commit -m "chore: regenerate derived state after merging <branch-name>"
   ```
   Scope the `git add` to whatever `emit-state`'s own output named as touched, per the
   `commit-in-this-fleet` skill where this repo has one — never a broad `git add -A`/`git add .`.
   **Also stage `planning/<block>/sdlc/sdlc-*state.json`** — the SDLC engines commit to the repo,
   never to `planning/` (which belongs to HQ), so a block's own run-state — including its
   append-only `bails[]` record — survives only if this step picks it up. Measured 2026-09-05:
   nine blocks' worth of run-state sat uncommitted all day for exactly this reason before this
   line existed.
   **Never push** — this command does not push under any flag; pushing is a separate, explicit step.

   Run it from the base branch (never a linked worktree — `emit-state` refuses there). If `mev` or
   `brain.toml` is absent (a standalone repo), skip this silently — the authored flip already merged
   and still stands. Do NOT hand-reimplement any derived surface. If it reports a `W_EMIT_NO_SENTINEL`
   warning, surface it rather than hand-authoring the missing sentinel.
6. **Delete the merged branch:**
   ```bash
   git branch -d <branch-name>
   ```
   Report: "Branch '<branch-name>' merged into <base> and deleted; derived surfaces regenerated and
   committed locally (not pushed)."

## Context / Files to Read

- `planning/harness.json` — validation suite (checks + gating flags); also read for
  `flow.prBase` by Step 0.5's diff-base resolution
- `planning/status.md` — current focus (to scope coverage check to recent work)
- `planning/*/sdlc/sdlc-task-state.json` — per-spec `/sdlc-task` run index; Step 0.5's fallback
  reads `branch` + `base_sha` from these when HEAD is the base branch with no merge commit
- `.git/CLOSE_OUT_RANGE` — scratch file this run writes in Step 0.5 with the resolved diff range
  (e.g. `main...HEAD` or `HEAD^1..HEAD`); Steps 1 and 2a both read it so they can never diverge.
  Lives under `.git/`, so it is never tracked and needs no cleanup.

## Report

**<= 10 lines.** First line: outcome + whether it needs the operator. Then <= 6 one-line
bullets. Link paths; never restate a file. See the `report-to-the-operator` skill.

```
<spec-slug> closed out — <gates>/<total> gates, coverage <ok | gap: ...>, docs <clean | patched: N>
<doc standard: N upgraded | M ticketed | K carried over — omit the line entirely if nothing applied>
- Logged + committed: <log.md entry title> / <commit sha>   (or why not, if --gap-check-only)
- <anything that failed or was skipped, with the real error>
Next: <command>
```
Never restate the doc sweep or the coverage table — say the verdict and link the file.

**The "Logged + committed" line is not optional and must name a real `log.md` entry and a real
commit sha.** It exists because a run that stopped before Step 4 otherwise produces a report that
looks identical to a complete one — gates green, coverage clean, docs patched — while the session
went unlogged and uncommitted. If you cannot fill that line in, do not paper over it: go and run
Step 4. The only case where it may say "skipped" is `--gap-check-only`, which does not reach Step 4
by design.
