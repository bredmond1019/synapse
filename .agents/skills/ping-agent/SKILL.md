description: How to send, receive, and answer a cross-lane message without letting the fast channel replace the durable one — addressing a peer through the BT.6.A registry, composing each of the five message kinds as a strict JSON envelope, verifying a received claim before acting on it, writing every ping to a durable home in addition to sending it, the interrupt discipline that limits which kinds may derail a block in flight, and the four-verdict response contract. Use BEFORE sending a message to a peer lane, whenever a message arrives in an inbox and must be triaged, and BEFORE acting on any claim another lane makes about state you have not checked yourself.

A ping is a claim. The receiver verifies it locally before acting on it, and the sender writes it
to disk in addition to sending it. Neither half is optional, and this skill is not a role system:
every lane agent does the same job — send, receive, verify, respond — in a different repo. The only
distinct role in the fleet is the commander (BT.6.D covers that half of the conversation).

## Addressing a peer

Address a peer through the **BT.6.A registry**, not a `ListAgents` nickname. `ListAgents` nicknames
are unstable across restart and carry no repo, lane, or roadmap — a lane you addressed five minutes
ago may be a different nickname now, or gone. The registry turns that volatile nickname into a
stable, addressable identity:

```
<lock_dir>/lane-agents/agent-*.json
```

`lock_dir` resolves the same way everywhere in this fleet: `--lock-dir` flag, else `FLEET_LOCK_DIR`
env var, else a `brain.toml` discovered by walking up from cwd, joined with `.fleet-locks`. Each
registry record is a `lane-agent.schema.json` claim — `agent_name` (the current `ListAgents`
nickname), `repo`, `lane`, `roadmap`, `started_at`, `heartbeat`. Read the registry to find who is
driving the lane you need; use `ListAgents` only afterward, to confirm that nickname is still live
before you send. Sending to a nickname you have not just confirmed against the registry is how a
message gets addressed to a lane that already closed.

## Composing: one envelope per kind

Every message is a **strict JSON envelope matching `.claude/workflows/message.schema.json`
field-for-field** — not a prose format. This is deliberate: the eventual engine-rs
structured-output port must be a mechanical translation of an already-typed shape, not a redesign
of a format that was never typed in the first place. This skill does not restate the schema's field
table — read `.claude/workflows/message.schema.json` for the authoritative shape; what follows is
one worked example per kind, written to:

Every envelope requires `verified_by`, in one of two shapes: **a block containing the literal
command that was run and its real output** (a command line, then its output on a following line),
or the string **`UNVERIFIED: <who claimed it>`** naming the claimant when you are relaying rather
than independently checking. Neither an empty string nor a bare adjective such as `measured`
satisfies it — that is the exact defect this field exists to catch.

#### Bastion coord (preferred)

If `bastion` is on PATH, write the envelope to a local JSON file (still shaped exactly like the
worked examples below — the wire format does not change) and hand it off with `bastion coord send
--repo <recipient-repo> --lane <recipient-lane> --file <path-to-envelope.json>`, which faces
`engine_core::coord::write::send` — the same function `POST /api/coordination/send` calls. It
writes the message into `--repo`/`--lane`'s inbox for you; verify `send` against `bastion coord
send --help` before use if the shape here ever looks stale. `--repo`/`--lane` here are the
**recipient's**, resolved from the BT.6.A registry as described above, not the sender's own.

##### Fallback: hand-written JSON (no bastion binary)

This fallback is permanent, not a placeholder for a future `bastion coord send` — write the
envelope directly into the recipient's inbox path when the binary is unavailable:

```
<lock_dir>/queue/<repo>/<lane>/inbox/<ts>-<uuid>.json
```

`<ts>` is an ISO-8601 **basic-form** UTC timestamp — `YYYYMMDDThhmmssZ`, no dashes, no colons — for
example `20260827T143011Z`. Mint it with:

```
date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ
```

Stripping the colons out of an extended-form stamp (`2026-08-27T14:30:11Z`) is **not** sufficient —
the dashes remain, and `scripts/check_messages.py`'s `FILENAME_RE` still rejects the result. Use the
`date` incantation above, not a string transform on an existing timestamp. `<uuid>` must equal the
record's `message_id` (already stated by the checker's module docstring); `FILENAME_RE` in
`scripts/check_messages.py` is the authority for the exact shape.

**Validate before treating a message as sent**: after writing an envelope into a peer's inbox
(whichever path sent it), run `python3 base-template/scripts/check_messages.py` from the brain root
and confirm 0 own-repo gating failures. This catches the filename shape above and every other
envelope field in one command — a hand-rolled sender guessing at any of them is the same defect.

**EDGE_RELEASED** — a dependency edge cleared on the sender's side and a waiting lane may be idling
on it, unsignalled:

```json
{
  "message_id": "b3f1c2a0-2222-4a11-9e77-000000000001",
  "sender": {"agent_name": "engine-rs-5b", "repo": "engine-rs", "lane": "data-contract", "roadmap": "autonomous-foundation"},
  "sent_at": "2026-08-22T14:03:11Z",
  "kind": "EDGE_RELEASED",
  "subject": {"repo": "bastion", "block": "BA.21.A"},
  "body": "engine-rs side of the data-contract dependency is now merged on main; BA.21.A is unblocked.",
  "durable_home": {"channel": "state-edge", "ref": "bastion:BA.21.A:depends_on[0]"},
  "verified_by": "git -C engine-rs log -1 --format=%H main\nf3a9c21 merge data-contract into main"
}
```

**FINDING** — a cross-lane observation worth relaying, the corpus's one measured real-world case
(cited below):

```json
{
  "message_id": "b3f1c2a0-2222-4a11-9e77-000000000002",
  "sender": {"agent_name": "mev-d8", "repo": "mev", "lane": "carryover-sweep", "roadmap": "autonomous-foundation"},
  "sent_at": "2026-08-21T09:41:00Z",
  "kind": "FINDING",
  "subject": {"repo": "base-template"},
  "body": "P0: carryover sweep found 30 of 202 entries are misfiled operator work gating nothing.",
  "durable_home": {"channel": "run-record", "ref": "base-template/planning/orchestration-run/autonomous-foundation/notes.md"},
  "verified_by": "mev carryover --json | jq '[.[] | select(.kind==\"deferred\" and .misfiled_operator)] | length'\n30"
}
```

**RENDEZVOUS** — a need for two lanes to synchronize before either proceeds:

```json
{
  "message_id": "b3f1c2a0-2222-4a11-9e77-000000000003",
  "sender": {"agent_name": "bastion-c4", "repo": "bastion", "lane": "d62-downstream-check", "roadmap": "autonomous-foundation"},
  "sent_at": "2026-08-22T15:10:05Z",
  "kind": "RENDEZVOUS",
  "subject": {"repo": "bastion"},
  "body": "D62 downstream check against bastion is DEFERRED until this lane goes idle. Ping back when your tree is quiet.",
  "durable_home": {"channel": "lane-log", "ref": "lane-log.jsonl:line-482"},
  "verified_by": "UNVERIFIED: relayed from bastion-c4 lane close notice"
}
```

**LEASE_RELEASE** — one kind covers both taking and releasing a repo lease, discriminated in the
body:

```json
{
  "message_id": "b3f1c2a0-2222-4a11-9e77-000000000004",
  "sender": {"agent_name": "okf-core-d0", "repo": "okf-core", "lane": "schema-fix", "roadmap": "autonomous-foundation"},
  "sent_at": "2026-08-22T16:00:00Z",
  "kind": "LEASE_RELEASE",
  "subject": {"repo": "okf-core"},
  "body": "RELEASE: exclusive lease on okf-core released, tree clean at commit a1b2c3d.",
  "durable_home": {"channel": "state-edge", "ref": "okf-core:lease-release-2026-08-22"},
  "verified_by": "git -C okf-core status --porcelain\n(empty)"
}
```

**QUERY** — a read-only question that implies no action by the receiver, kept separate so a question
is never dressed up as a finding:

```json
{
  "message_id": "b3f1c2a0-2222-4a11-9e77-000000000005",
  "sender": {"agent_name": "base-template-b6", "repo": "base-template", "lane": "lane-coordination", "roadmap": "autonomous-foundation"},
  "sent_at": "2026-08-22T16:20:30Z",
  "kind": "QUERY",
  "subject": {"repo": "engine-rs", "block": "ER.9.C"},
  "body": "Is ER.9.C's structured-output port still blocked on the message schema landing, or has that cleared?",
  "durable_home": {"channel": "carryover", "ref": "base-template:query-er9c-status"},
  "verified_by": "UNVERIFIED: base-template-b6, asking not asserting"
}
```

## Rule 1 — verify before acting, and before relaying

A ping is a claim the receiver verifies **locally** before acting on it, and the verification is
recorded. This is not invented policy: it is what the fleet's only real cross-lane exchange already
did. Verbatim from
`base-template/planning/orchestration-run/autonomous-foundation/notes.md` (2026-08-21): **"Verified
here rather than taken on report"** — the receiver independently re-checked all ten schema
properties, the ticket's `state.json` registration, and `mev lanes --json` before accepting a P0
raised by the mev lane. Without this rule a wrong claim propagates at the speed of the queue: the
next lane that reads the message inherits the error, and nothing in the channel itself catches it.

**The relay is bound too, not only the receiver.** A relay is any lane that composes a new envelope
re-asserting a claim it did not itself check — passing along "measured and NEGATIVE" from an
upstream message, or restating another lane's finding in its own words. MEASURED across the
2026-08-23 autonomous-foundation run (`liaison-retro.md` section B): three relayed claims were
caught wrong by their receivers, each traceable to a relay that re-asserted an adjective
("measured") instead of carrying the evidence — one was a flat VERIFIED-FALSE that one `ls -la`
would have caught before it was ever sent. **Before composing an envelope that repeats someone
else's claim, either independently verify it yourself, or mark it `UNVERIFIED: <who claimed it>`
in `verified_by` rather than re-asserting it as your own.** A relay is never entitled to upgrade
another lane's unverified claim into an asserted one just by restating it.

## Rule 2 — always also to disk

`SendMessage` is ephemeral. An offline or restarted target loses it with no error. So every ping is
additionally written to a **durable home** — not instead of sending, alongside it. There are
exactly three:

1. **Lane log** — `lane-log.jsonl`
2. **`state.json` edge** — a `depends_on` edge or block field
3. **Carryover** — a `carryover[]` entry (routed per the four kinds, see the repo's `CLAUDE.md`)

`/orchestrate` rule 8 already states the durable design: **"each agent reports the state change it
wants; one writer applies them centrally."** A ping does not replace that channel — it accelerates
it, giving the waiting lane a faster signal than polling `state.json` would. The envelope's required
`durable_home` field (`channel` + `ref`) is the mechanical form of this rule: a message with no
`durable_home` is not a valid message, and a received message whose `durable_home` cannot be found
on disk is a claim that has not yet been verified (Rule 1) — do not act on it until it has.

## Rule 3 — interrupt discipline

A ping lands in a session that may be mid-block. **Only `RENDEZVOUS` and `LEASE_RELEASE` may
interrupt a block in flight** — both concern the tree and are objectively time-critical. Every other
kind (`EDGE_RELEASED`, `FINDING`, `QUERY`) is triaged at the **next block boundary**, not before.

Getting this wrong trades one measured failure mode for a worse one. Without the sweep-avoidance
discipline of `/orchestrate` rule 8, cross-lane state gets silently clobbered; without this rule,
the queue trades that sweep problem for a **derailment problem** — a lane that stops mid-block loses
exactly the context that cannot be written down. Check the inbox at boundaries; do not poll it
mid-block for anything but `RENDEZVOUS` or `LEASE_RELEASE`.

## The response contract

Every response is **ACK** plus exactly one of four verdicts:

- **ACCEPTED** — the claim verified and the receiver acted on it
- **VERIFIED-FALSE** — the receiver checked and the claim did not hold
- **DEFERRED** — verification or action is queued for the next block boundary
- **NOT-MINE** — this message's subject is not this lane's concern

Every response **must name where the item was filed** — which lane-log line, which `state.json`
edge, which carryover slug. A response that accepts a claim without naming a durable home is not a
response; it is exactly the unsignalled state Rule 2 exists to prevent.

## What this is not

Not a role system. Every lane agent — sender, receiver, verifier — does the same job in a different
repo. The only distinct role in the fleet is the commander. Two values (lane agent, commander) is
not a role system; name them and stop.

## Out of scope here

- The queue layout and drain mechanics (inbox → processing → done) — BT.6.B owns those.
- Wiring block-boundary triage into `/begin-orchestration` and `/orchestrate` — BT.6.E.
- The commander's half of the conversation — BT.6.D.
