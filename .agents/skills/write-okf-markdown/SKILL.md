description: How to create or edit a markdown file in this brain without red-gating the fleet — whether the file needs OKF frontmatter at all, the five traps that red-gate it (four break YAML parsing; the fifth parses fine and only `--sync` catches it), the index.md row Standing Rule 7 requires, the cross-repo `related:` prefix, and why a relative markdown link that climbs out of `planning/` resolves against the vault instead of the repo. Use BEFORE writing any new `.md` file anywhere in agentic-portfolio or a sub-repo, before adding frontmatter to an existing one, before linking from a planning doc to anything outside `planning/`, and when `bastion validate-brain` reports E_STRUCT_ORPHAN_FILE, E_GRAPH_DANGLING_RELATED, W_GRAPH_ISOLATED_NODE, E_LINK_DEAD_MARKDOWN, E_SYNC_WATERMARK_MALFORMED, or "mapping values are not allowed in this context".

# Writing markdown in this brain

Three separate obligations, in this order. Most breakages come from doing #1 and skipping #2.

1. **Frontmatter** — if the file is a corpus member (Step 1 decides).
2. **An `index.md` row** — Standing Rule 7. Skipping this is the most common failure.
3. **Validation** — one flag per invocation; they do not compose.

The schema tables (every field, every controlled vocabulary, per-type examples) live in
`docs/okf-frontmatter.md`, governed by `docs/decisions/D27-enriched-okf-frontmatter.md`. **This skill is the procedure, not the
schema** — read that doc when you need to pick a `type`, a `layer`, or a `status`.

---

## Step 1 — Does this file need frontmatter at all?

Deterministic, from `core/mev/src/brain/crawl.rs::is_corpus_member`. A file is a corpus member iff,
**relative to its owning repo root**, it is:

- exactly `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, or `index.md` at the repo root, **or**
- anywhere under `planning/` or `docs/` (any depth).

> Those three filenames are matched **literally**. `GEMINI.md` and `AGENT.md` sit beside `CLAUDE.md`
> at the same repo roots and are **not** corpus members — they carry no frontmatter obligation and no
> index row, and editing one changes nothing a gate can see. Do not "correct" `CLAUDE.md` to another
> agent's filename anywhere in this document; the rule is the string, not the tool.

Everything else — `src/*.md`, a stray root-level `.md`, anything under an unregistered directory — is
**out of corpus**: no frontmatter obligation, no index row, no validation.

Then subtract the **ephemeral** names, from `crawl.rs::is_ephemeral`. These are excluded even inside
`planning/`:

`handoff.md` · `tasks.md` · `breakdown.md` · `worklog.md` · **any filename starting with `_`**

> **The `_` prefix is a debugging trap, not just a convention.** A probe named `_zz_test.md` is
> invisible to `validate-brain`. You will conclude detection is broken when it is working exactly as
> designed. If you are testing whether a check fires, do not name the fixture with a leading `_`.

`skip_dirs` in `brain.toml` removes whole trees regardless: `target`, `node_modules`, `.git`,
`.claude`, `.agent`, `archive`, `venv`, `.venv`, `sdlc`, `_planning`, `.mev-history`.

> **`_planning` is skipped, and every `planning/` is a symlink into it.** The corpus sees plan content
> *through* the symlink. This is why every cross-repo `rg`/`grep` sweep must pass `-L` — a sweep
> without it silently skips every leaf repo's plan content and reports a clean result that is a lie
> (Standing Rule 9).

**In corpus → continue. Out of corpus → write the file and stop.**

---

## Step 2 — Write the frontmatter

Three fields are required — `type`, `title`, `description`. Everything else is optional but earns its
place: `doc_id`, `layer`, `project`, `status`, `keywords`, `related` sharpen retrieval and create graph
edges. Two more, `created` and `updated`, are pure documentation — nothing validates them.

```yaml
---
type: Reference
title: Human-readable title
description: One line saying what this file contains, written for a searcher.
doc_id: kebab-case-stable-id     # optional; defaults to the filename stem
layer: [meta]                    # controlled — see the schema doc
project: brain                   # controlled; OMIT for cross-cutting docs
status: active
keywords: [three, to, seven, concrete, terms]
related: [some-real-doc-id]
created: 2026-08-29              # when this file was first written — see below
updated: 2026-08-29              # bump it EVERY time you revise the file — see below
---
```

**`created` / `updated` are yours to maintain.** They were added to `okf_core::OkfFrontmatter` on
2026-08-29 (okf-core block `OK.ticket.add-created-updated-frontmatter`) so they round-trip instead of
being dropped. **No gate checks them, no format is enforced, and no command fills or refreshes them** —
a stale `updated` is invisible. Use `YYYY-MM-DD`, keep them after `related:` (the order the serializer
writes), and leave both off rather than let them go stale. Existing docs omit them; **do not backfill.**
They are not `timestamp` (Log/ProjectStatus freshness, ISO-8601 with timezone, trap 4 below) and not
`synced_from` (the cross-repo watermark behind `E_SYNC_DRIFT`).

### `created:` / `updated:` — write them, and bump `updated:`

They are optional to the *schema* and load-bearing in *practice*, which is a combination that
reliably produces an empty field. Measured 2026-09-07: **57 and 52 of 657** frontmatter files in
the corpus carried them — under 9% — and **0 of 25** authored pre-plan docs did.

Fill both when you create a file, and **bump `updated:` whenever you meaningfully revise it**. Not
for a typo; yes for anything that changes what the document says.

**What reads them.** `planning/open-work/scripts/update_pre_plan.py` decides which folders under
`open-work/pre-plan/` are cold enough to `/archive`, and `updated:` is its first-choice signal.
When it is absent the script falls back to `git log --follow --diff-filter=MA`, then to mtime, and
marks the row so the difference is visible — because those are **mechanical** dates. A reformat, a
link repair or a fleet-wide path migration all move a git date without the thinking having moved,
and exactly that happened: HQ D87 relocated 19 folders in one commit, so every naive git date read
as "touched today". An authored `updated:` is the only date that means what a reader assumes it
means.

So: a doc with no `updated:` still gets a date — just a worse one, derived from whoever last
touched the bytes. Write the honest one.

**The seven authoring commands already seed both** (`/capture`, `/assess`, `/seams`, `/sequence`,
`/plan`, `/define-design-system`, `/define-polish-standard`). If you are hand-writing a file, you
are the one supplying them.

### The five traps that break the gates

`hooks/pre-commit` exists solely because of the first one. It recurred **three times on 2026-08-06
alone, across three independent agent sessions**, after already being fixed and re-filed as a systemic
gate the day before.

Traps 1-4 break YAML parsing. Trap 5 parses fine and fails a different gate.

| # | Trap | Why it breaks |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **A `: ` (colon-space) inside an unquoted scalar** | YAML reads it as a nested mapping → `mapping values are not allowed in this context`. Most often in `description:` or `title:`. |
| 2 | **An unquoted `#`** | Starts a comment; the rest of your line vanishes. |
| 3 | **An em-dash clause in an unquoted plain scalar** | Combined with a colon or `#`, same failure class. Em dashes alone are fine — this is about what surrounds them. |
| 4 | **A date-only `timestamp`** | `timestamp: 2026-08-19` where full ISO-8601 with timezone is required. This had the pre-push gate **red fleet-wide** on 2026-08-14. |
| 5 | **A `+0000` UTC offset in `timestamp` or `synced_from`** | Valid ISO-8601, **invalid RFC3339** — the offset needs a colon: `+00:00`. Parses as YAML, passes `--structure`/`--links`/`--graph`/`--state`, then fails `--sync` with `E_SYNC_WATERMARK_MALFORMED`. Measured 2026-08-30. |

#### Trap 5 in detail — the one that looks right

```yaml
timestamp: "2026-08-30T21:18:50+0000"    # WRONG — no colon in the offset
timestamp: "2026-08-30T21:18:50+00:00"   # right
timestamp: "2026-08-30T21:18:50Z"        # also right, and shorter
```

**Where it comes from.** `date` produces the broken form by default, and **the obvious fix does not
work on this fleet's machines**. Measured on macOS 2026-08-30:

```bash
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%z     # 2026-08-30T21:54:54+0000   WRONG (%z has no colon)
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%:z    # 2026-08-30T21:54:54:z      WORSE — see below
date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ      # 2026-08-30T21:54:54Z       correct, and the one to use
```

**`%:z` is a GNU coreutils extension.** BSD `date` — which is what macOS ships, so both a dev Mac
and the Mac Mini — does not implement it and emits a literal `:z` instead of failing. That is a
worse value than the bug it was meant to fix, and it fails the same gate. **On this fleet, use the
`Z` form.**

In Python, `datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat()` is correct (`…+00:00`); `strftime("%z")` has
exactly the same defect as `date` (`…+0000`).

**Why it is worth its own row.** Trap 4 is a *date-only* value, which looks obviously incomplete.
This one is a full timestamp with a timezone and reads as correct at a glance — and the four gates
you would normally run all pass, so a careful agent can check its work and still miss it.

**Why it matters more than a one-file mistake.** `--sync` is **corpus-wide**: it compares every
repo's `status_file` `timestamp` against its `cache_doc` `synced_from`. One malformed value fails
**every repo's push**, not just the one you touched — the same blast radius as `E_SYNC_DRIFT`
(see `fleet-push-discipline` §5). Worse, `/log-work` writes both fields from one timestamp, so a
single bad `date` call plants it in two files at once.

**Check it explicitly.** The four usual flags will not catch it:

```bash
bastion validate-brain --sync    # the ONLY flag that reads these two fields
```

**The fix is always the same: quote the scalar.**

```yaml
# Wrong — the ": " makes this a nested mapping and fails all four gates at once
description: The trap: a colon inside an unquoted scalar

# Right
description: "The trap: a colon inside an unquoted scalar"
```

**Why this is worse than it looks:** `--structure`, `--links`, `--graph` and `--state` all load the
same frontmatter. One bad `description:` fails **all four simultaneously**, and looks like four broken
gates for a change unrelated to any of them.

### `related:` — the cross-repo prefix

A bare `doc_id` resolves against the **authoring file's own scope**. Correct only when the target
lives in that same scope. Anything else must be written `<scope>:<doc_id>`.

**The prefix is not always the repo slug, and this part is not guessable:**

- A doc under a sub-brain tier's own path (`core/docs/...`) resolves by **tier** → `core:`
- A doc under a repo's vaulted planning tree (`core/_planning/engine-rs/...`) resolves by **repo** →
  `engine-rs:`, *not* `core:`, even though the path sits under `core/`

```yaml
# Wrong — silently resolves to the local scope, which has no such doc_id
related: [sequence-orchestration-extensions]
# Right
related: [engine-rs:sequence-orchestration-extensions]
```

Getting it wrong raises `E_GRAPH_DANGLING_RELATED`, and **the blast radius is corpus-wide** — a
`--graph` error red-gates every concurrent orchestration lane across the fleet, not just the repo that
authored the bad edge.

A `doc_id`-bearing file with **zero** outbound edges is an isolated graph node
(`W_GRAPH_ISOLATED_NODE`). If you set a `doc_id`, populate `related` with at least one real target.

---

## Step 3 — Add the `index.md` row (Standing Rule 7)

**This is the step that gets skipped, and it red-gates the fleet.** From
`core/mev/src/brain/structure.rs`: every corpus file in a directory must be referenced by **that
directory's** `index.md`, and every index row must point at a file that exists.

- **Direct children only.** Subdirectories are covered by their own `index.md`; a parent index does not
  cover a child directory's files.
- **A directory with no `index.md` has no coverage obligation** — no index, no orphan flags. Adding the
  first `index.md` to a directory therefore obliges you to list *every* sibling in it at once.
- The reference must be a **markdown or `file://` link**. `[[wikilinks]]`, external `http(s)://` URLs,
  and targets outside the corpus root are ignored by the check and will not satisfy it.
- If the new file changes the scope of a parent directory's `index.md`, update that too — propagate up.

| Diagnostic | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E_STRUCT_ORPHAN_FILE` | A corpus file exists that its directory's `index.md` does not reference. Located at the orphan file. |
| `E_STRUCT_DANGLING_ROW` | An index row points at a file that is not on disk. Located at the `index.md`. |
| `W_STRUCT_DANGLING_ROW_EPHEMERAL` | A row points at a known-ephemeral name (`handoff.md`, `tasks.md`). Expected, not drift — the standard "delete after consuming" handoff row. |

---

### Linking out of `planning/` — the symlink trap

**Never write a relative markdown link that climbs above `planning/`.** Every `planning/` is a
symlink into the brain's `_planning/` vault, and `validate-brain --links` resolves link targets
**physically**, through the symlink — so `..` walks out of the *vault*, not out of the repo.

```
learn-ai/planning/decisions/D12.md      # where you are reading the file
_planning/learn-ai/decisions/D12.md     # where it physically lives

[`docs/voice.md`](../../docs/voice.md)  # you meant  learn-ai/docs/voice.md
                                        # it resolves _planning/docs/voice.md  -> E_LINK_DEAD_MARKDOWN
```

The error message makes this genuinely hard to read, because it prints the *lexical* path it was
given while having resolved the *physical* one:

```
error [E_LINK_DEAD_MARKDOWN] learn-ai/planning/decisions/D12-....md
  — dead markdown link: '../../docs/voice.md' does not exist
    (resolved: '<home>/.../learn-ai/planning/decisions/../../docs/voice.md')
```

Collapse that printed path by hand and it reads `learn-ai/docs/voice.md`, which **does** exist — so
the natural conclusion is that the checker is broken. It is not. Trust the error, not the path in it.

**What to write instead**, in order of preference:

| Target | Write |
|---|---|
| Another file **inside** `planning/` | A normal relative link — `[notes](../voice-fingerprint/notes.md)`. These are fine; both ends are in the vault. |
| A file **outside** `planning/` (`docs/`, `src/`, `content/`) | A **bare path in backticks**, not a link — `` `learn-ai/docs/voice.md` `` |
| A file in another repo | Repo-qualified bare path — `` `core/mev/src/learn_ai/voice_tells.rs` `` |
| A `related:` frontmatter edge | A `doc_id`, cross-repo-prefixed if needed — that layer is symlink-safe (see above) |

A bare path costs the reader one copy-paste and costs the corpus nothing. A `file://` absolute link
also passes, but it hardcodes one machine's home directory — use it only where the surrounding file
already does.

**Say why, in the file.** When you drop a link to a bare path for this reason, add a one-line note —
otherwise the next author "fixes" your path back into a link and re-breaks the gate.

---

## Step 4 — Validate

**One flag per invocation.** `validate-brain`'s flags do **not** compose — the dispatch is an
if/else-if chain with a fixed precedence (`links > structure > state > graph > sync > base`), so a
second flag is silently ignored and you get a false green on the check you thought you ran.

```bash
bastion validate-brain --structure   # index.md <-> directory coverage
bastion validate-brain --links       # dead markdown / file:// / [[wikilink]] targets
bastion validate-brain --graph       # related: edge integrity
bastion validate-brain --state       # state.json schema + block graph
```

> **A piped command's `$?` is the pipe's, not the command's.** `bastion validate-brain --graph | tail`
> reports success while the command itself exits 1. Redirect to a file, then check `$?`.

Both `mev validate-brain` and `bastion validate-brain` exist with the same flags — `bastion` delegates
to `mev`. HQ's `planning/harness.json` gates on the `bastion` form; use it for consistency.

---

## Deleting a doc — the error lands on OTHER files, in two waves

Deleting a `.md` is not the inverse of adding one. **Every error it causes appears somewhere else,
so a path-scoped check on what you deleted reports clean.** It arrives in two waves, and fixing the
first surfaces the second — expect to run the gates at least three times.

**Wave 1 — dead links (`--links`), on every file that pointed AT the deleted doc:**
- `[text](path/to/deleted.md)` markdown links
- `file:///abs/path/to/deleted.md` URIs, including in archived or superseded documents nobody
  thinks of as live
- `[[wikilinks]]`

**Wave 2 — dangling edges (`--graph`), on every file naming its `doc_id` in `related:`.** These do
**not** appear until wave 1 is clean, because `--links` and `--graph` are separate flags and you
only run the second after the first goes green.

Measured 2026-08-20 retiring `/sdlc-block` and `/sdlc-run`: deleting 12 doc pages produced **0**
errors on the deleted paths, then **58** `E_LINK_DEAD_MARKDOWN` across `index.md` and `commands.md`
in six repos, then **13** `E_GRAPH_DANGLING_RELATED` on the *surviving* `sdlc-flow.md` /
`sdlc-task.md` pages once links were clean.

**Do this before deleting, not after:**

```bash
# 1. Who links to it? (all three link forms, symlink- and gitignore-blind by default -> -L -uu)
rg -L -uu -l 'deleted-file\.md|\[\[deleted-doc-id\]\]' .

# 2. Who names its doc_id in related:?  Use the doc_id, NOT the filename - they differ.
rg -L -uu -l 'related:.*deleted-doc-id' .

# 3. Which index.md lists it? (Standing Rule 7 in reverse - the row must go too)
rg -L -uu -l 'deleted-file\.md' --glob 'index.md'
```

Fix all three sets **in the same change as the deletion**. Then run `--links` and `--graph`
separately, in that order, and re-run both after each fix.

**Two traps:**
- **`related:` holds `doc_id`s, not filenames.** Grepping the filename finds the links and misses
  every graph edge. `doc_id` defaults to the filename stem but is often set explicitly to something
  else — read the deleted file's frontmatter before you delete it, and note the `doc_id` down.
- **A retired doc's *content* usually outlives its links.** De-linking a reference to a deleted
  engine leaves prose that still describes it as live. Removing the link makes the gate green; it
  does not make the sentence true. Say what changed, or delete the sentence.

### When the target is gone, not misspelled

The dangling-edge fixes above assume the target still exists and you named it wrong — a missing
`<scope>:` prefix, a typo, a `doc_id` that differs from the filename. `E_GRAPH_DANGLING_RELATED`
says so when that is the case: it ends with **`did you mean <scope>:<doc_id>?`**, and taking the
suggestion is the whole fix.

**With no `did you mean` clause, the target is genuinely gone**, and there are exactly two correct
moves. Pick by whether something replaced it:

| Situation | Do this |
|---|---|
| A successor doc exists (superseded, renamed, split, merged) | Repoint the edge at the successor's `doc_id` — cross-repo-prefixed if it lives in another vault |
| Nothing replaced it — the thing itself is gone | **Delete the edge**, and fix the prose that referenced it |

Deleting the edge is a real answer, not a cop-out. `related:` is a structural claim that two live
documents are connected; an edge to a document that no longer exists asserts something false, and
keeping it costs every future `--graph` run.

**Never repoint at the archived copy.** `archive` is in `brain.toml`'s `skip_dirs`, so archived docs
are not in the corpus at all — measured 2026-08-31, the manifest holds 1,482 entries and **zero**
under any `planning/archive/`. An edge pointing into the archive dangles exactly like the one you
were fixing, so this move converts a resolved error back into an open one.

If you cannot tell which row applies, that is a question about the *content*, not the frontmatter:
read the deleting commit. `git log --diff-filter=D -- <path>` names it, and its message usually says
whether the doc was superseded or dropped.

**Do not leave it dangling because it is not your file.** A `related:` error is corpus-wide, so
whoever runs `--graph` next inherits it, and they have less context than you do. If the fix genuinely
belongs to another lane — the file is mid-write, or the successor is theirs to name — say so
explicitly where it will be seen (a `carryover[]` entry, or a message to that lane), rather than
leaving a red gate with no owner.

## Before you commit

- [ ] In corpus? (Step 1) — if not, none of this applies
- [ ] Frontmatter present, with `type` / `title` / `description`
- [ ] Every scalar containing `: ` or `#` is **quoted**
- [ ] `timestamp` (Log / ProjectStatus only) is full ISO-8601 **with timezone**, and the offset is
      RFC3339 — `Z` or `+00:00`, never `+0000` (trap 5). Same for `synced_from`.
- [ ] If you touched `timestamp` or `synced_from`, `bastion validate-brain --sync` is clean — no
      other flag reads them, and this one gates the whole fleet's pushes
- [ ] If `created` / `updated` are present, they are `YYYY-MM-DD` and `updated` reflects *this* edit
- [ ] Controlled fields (`layer` / `project` / `status`) use real vocabulary values — check the schema doc
- [ ] Cross-scope `related:` targets carry a `<scope>:` prefix
- [ ] Any dangling edge whose target is *gone* was repointed at a successor or deleted — never
      repointed into `planning/archive/`, which is outside the corpus
- [ ] A row exists in the directory's `index.md`
- [ ] No relative markdown link climbs **out of** `planning/` — bare backticked path instead
- [ ] `--structure`, `--graph` and `--links` all run clean

`hooks/pre-commit` catches trap #1 at commit time — but only if hooks are enabled
(`git config core.hooksPath hooks`), and it **degrades silently to a pass** when `python3` or PyYAML is
missing. Do not treat a green commit as proof the frontmatter parses.

---

## When a gate is red and it is not yours

Errors are attributed **by delta, not by path** (`docs/decisions/D64-push-gate-delta-attribution.md`).
With concurrent agents, `--structure` frequently goes red because another session added a file and has
not written its index row yet. Check the error's path before assuming it is your change: if the file is
one you did not create, the session that created it owns the fix — say so rather than racing its
index edit.
